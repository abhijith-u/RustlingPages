#### My favourite quotes from books:

- The China Room
  > You know what the best thing is about falling out of love? It sets you free. Because when you’re in love it is everything, it is imprisoning, it is all there is, and you’d do anything, anything, to keep that love. But when it withers you can suddenly see the rest of the world again, everything else floods back into the places that love had monopolised.

- The Illicit Happiness of Other People
  > You must see this, Unni. In a world full of Sai Shankarans, you would have become king, if only you had waited. Look at Sai, he does not know why he lives but he lives, and he lives because he does not know why he must die. He will go on this way, doing his little things, enjoying the little victories, adopting morals invented by other people, secretly supporting the ideologies of third-rate men and, at dinner time, quoting the philosophies of the extraordinary whom people like him have never allowed to live in peace.

- Descent of Man, Charles Darwin
  > Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.


- Neil Gaiman, The Sandman, Vol. 9: The Kindly Ones
  > MORPHEUS: I did not intend to hurt you.
  > THESSALY: And what if you did not? Intent and outcome are so rarely coincident.

- The Unwaba's Revelations (Samit Basu)
  > ...everyone has secrets and dark histories; no one wants to know more about you than what you want to show them. You are whatever you’ve made the effort to look like.



- Not All Robots by Mark Russell
  > ...all power is based on the illusion of control. Somewhere inside, even they know it’s an illusion.
  > Though they won't admit it to themselves, they don't even control their own fate, much less ours.
  > That's how they can have everything and still feel like victims>


- Billionaire Island by Mark Russel

  > People don't want freedom or justice, or even a world that makes sense. All they want is to feel like someone's in charge. They want a prison that doesn't ask too much of them.

  >The human race is doomed. The earth is like this big pina colada. Everyone wants to drink from the coconut. Agriculture... The industrial revolution... The tech boom... All just one big effort to create a bigger straw and now the coconut is almost empty. That's not my fault, is it?


- Travelling To Mars by Mark Russel

  > In the end we're all lint rollers, picking up pain and regret as we along, strangely unable to put any of it down. Perhaps because, inside, we all suspect that healing is a form of forgetting. And it's better to be in pain.

  > Is it still called regret when you couldn't have done anything differently?

  > Immortality, when you get down to it, is simply a euphemism for not being forgotten yet.

  > Nostalgia being a proven method for distracting us from the fact that we are all dying.

  > Because a shared delusion is no delusion at all, but a world made bearable for each other.

  > Memory being a ziplock bag of leftovers we never intended to eat. We find them in the freezer years later to wonder why we ever though this was worth saving.

- George Monbiot
> If wealth was the inevitable result of hard work and enterprise, every woman in Africa would be a millionaire.

- Charles de Gaulle
> Patriotism is when love for your country comes first; nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.

- Dunning-Kruger effect
> People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. This overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it.

> Most people dont listen to understand, they listen to respond.

- Joseph Goebbels 
> Propaganda works best when those who are being manipulated are confident they are acting on their own free will."

- Stephen Hawking
>  “The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance. It is the illusion of knowledge”

- Hannah Arendt (Political philosopher)
 > “If everybody always lies to you, the consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer… And a people that no longer can believe anything cannot make up its mind. It is deprived not only of its capacity to act but also of its capacity to think and to judge. And with such a people you can then do what you please.”

> The last thing I am scared of is God. The first thing I am scared of are his followers.


> Being taught to avoid talking about politics and religion has led to a lack of understanding of politics and religion. What we should have been taught was how to have a civil conversation about a difficult topic.


- E. O. Wilson
> We exist in a bizarre combination of Stone Age emotions, medieval beliefs, and god-like technology.

- Carl Jung
> Thinking is difficult thats why most people judge.

- Marcus Aurelius
> Live a good life. If there are Gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are Gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no Gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.

- Agent Smith/The Matrix
> Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus.

- James Baldwin
> We can disagree and still love each other unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression, denial of my humanity and right to exist.

- Arthur C. Clarke
> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. 

- Carl Sagan
>What counts is not what sounds plausible, not what we would like to believe, not what one or two witnesses claim, but only what is supported by hard evidence rigorously and skeptically examined. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

- Stephen Hawkings
>If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.

- Charles Darwin
> All observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service.

- Aldous Huxley
> The propagandist’s purpose is to make one set of people forget that the other set is human. By robbing them of their personality, he puts them outside the pale of moral obligation.

Leadership in the absence of a skill is just aspiring to run a cult of personality.

- Malcolm-X
> If you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, there's no progress. If you pull it all the way out that's not progress. Progress is healing the wound that the blow made. And they haven't even pulled the knife out much less heal the wound.

-  Anatole France
> The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread.

  >And when the axe came into the woods the trees said "The handle is one of us."
