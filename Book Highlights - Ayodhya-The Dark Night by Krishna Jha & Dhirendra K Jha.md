[Ayodhya-The Dark Night by Krishna Jha & Dhirendra K. Jha](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17208157-ayodhya)

#### BACKGROUND:
> The quick and massive government reprisal in the aftermath of Gandhi’s assassination had taught the Hindu Mahasabha leaders several lessons. One was to avoid confrontation with the government so that they could extract maximum political advantage out of their act. Another was to involve a section of the Congress that was sympathetic to their cause.
---
> After the assassination of Gandhi in 1948 until the death of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in 1950, the Congress party was beset with an intense intra-party power struggle. The fight between the two power blocs in the Congress – Hindu conservatives led by Patel and secularists led by Nehru – came out in the open. By the time this battle was won by Nehru in late 1950, the incidents of the night of 22 December 1949 had got lost in legal thickets, and the mood of the nation had changed, with the secular fabric seemingly no longer threatened by Hindu revivalists. As the focus shifted following the promulgation of the Constitution of India on 26 January 1950, almost all the players of the Hindu Mahasabha’s Ayodhya strategy either lost their relevance or, in cases where some of them managed to remain in currency, their ability to break the secular equilibrium got severely restricted and their link with the night became part of this missing link of modern India’s history.

#### AYODHYA:

> Background:
> - Shaiva nagas – those who worship Lord Shiva as the supreme deity and Shankaracharya
> - Vaishnava nagas or vairagis – those who worship Lord Vishnu or one of his manifestations as the supreme deity and regard Ramananda (a
> Vaishnava teacher born several centuries after Shankaracharya) as their Adi Guru.
> - Nirvani Akhara is one of the three major militant ascetic camps of the Ramanandi sect, the other two being the Nirmohi and the Digambari akharas, each with its principal centre in Ayodhya.

---

> The claim of the Nirmohi Akhara over the janmabhoomi would automatically be diluted if Abhiram Das, a member of the Nirvani Akhara, succeeded in installing an idol of Lord Rama inside the Babri Masjid – almost 50 feet away from the Ramachabutara. The ‘real janmabhoomi’ that would thus emerge inside the mosque would make the janmabhoomi owned for almost a century by the Nirmohi Akhara redundant. And by becoming the Janmabhoomi Uddharak, Abhiram Das would have sole control over this potentially most significant spot in Ayodhya.

---

> The idea that eventually changed the politics of India, though much later than its originators had anticipated, emerged for the first time among three friends – Maharaja Pateshwari Prasad Singh, head of the princely state of Balrampur, Mahant Digvijai Nath and K.K.K. Nair.

---


> Not long before Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination, Mahant Digvijai Nath, one of the most powerful leaders of the Mahasabha in the United Provinces and mahant of the famous Gorakhnath Temple in Gorakhpur, a district not far from Ayodhya, was already considering a fresh attempt to take possession of the Babri Masjid. The mahant laid before him the strategy to get back Sri Ramjanmabhoomi in Ayodhya, apart from Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi and Sri Krishna janmabhoomi in Mathura. This was where the idea of an Ayodhya strategy was born.

---


> By all accounts, the investigation and trial into the conspiracy to kill Mahatma Gandhi was far from perfect and made no serious attempt to put the accused behind bars. As Savarkar was let off by the court, so was Mahant Digvijai Nath. And as Savarkar was implicated by the Justice Jeevan Lal Kapur Commission, so was Mahant Digvijai Nath.

---


> Mahant Digvijai Nath was politically the most cunning sadhu of the twentieth century. The game he played was carefully considered. Here was a sadhu who understood politics sufficiently to deal with the Congress on equal terms, but asserted his Hindu identity strongly enough to never be seen to grovel.

---


> The conversion of the Babri Masjid into a temple dedicated to Lord Rama might have been a localized phenomenon, but its impact was designed to be felt nationwide. It is another thing that the right-wing – which hoped to achieve political gains from the events at Ayodhya – did not manage to do so in the short term. Despite the occasional demands by the party to take possession of contentious religious places in the past, they had never been a major issue, perhaps because such disputes had never provided a basis for large-scale political mobilization. In 1934, Ayodhya had witnessed a major communal riot, sparked off by the rumour of cow slaughter in a nearby village (Shahjahanpur). During the riot, a part of the Babri Masjid had also been damaged by a section of Hindus. ‘However, the Mosque was repaired and reconditioned by a Muslim contractor at the expense of the British government.’ The incident could not provide fodder for the lasting mobilization of Hindus even in Ayodhya. There had been a number of such instances, many of them created by the Hindu Mahasabha, but none could develop into a focal point politically even in places where the government delayed taking action. But the India of 1949 was different. In the post-Partition period, many Congress leaders sympathetic to the idea of Hindu nationalism were carrying out projects which were highly regarded by the Mahasabhaites. One such example was the reconstruction of the Somnath Temple in Gujarat which started in late 1947 and created considerable debate in the Congress, the government, and among people in general.

---

> When Sardar Patel arrived in Junagarh on 12 November 1947 to direct the occupation of the state by the Indian Army, he also displayed his Hindu credentials and announced that the temple of Somnath would be rebuilt. Somnath Temple episode did not merely strengthen the Hindu traditionalists in the Congress, it also emboldened the militant Hindu communalists, creating for the Hindu Mahasabha an inspirational backdrop, especially when it started looking for ways to overcome the stigma of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. A forcible occupation of the Babri Masjid could have had an effect similar to the aftermath of the Gandhi assassination, but a surreptitious capture would have been a brilliant, yet simple way of occupying the structure and turning it into an emotive issue to mobilize Hindus.

---

> One may wonder if the Mahasabhaites would still have gone ahead with their Ayodhya strategy had the ground conducive for Hindu communalists not been prepared by the Congress in the UP, particularly by its chief minister, Govind Ballabh Pant, in the course of the campaign for the Assembly by-election in Faizabad towards the middle of 1948. The methods Pant employed to crush his arch rival Acharya Narendra Dev, a prominent socialist, in Ayodhya (which was part of the Faizabad constituency) were unprecedented in the history of the Congress. They were comparable perhaps only to the pitch that Muslim League leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah had used through a more crude use of religion to win the 1946 elections for the Constituent Assembly – a move that had made partition based on religion inevitable. What Pant created was a milder version of the same pitch – a more or less open call to the Hindus of Ayodhya to side with the Congress so that the ‘atheist’ Acharya, who was said to have the backing of the Muslims of Ayodhya and Faizabad, could be shown his place for not displaying reverence to the religion he belonged to. This marked the end of the grand old party as a representative of the national movement and the beginning of the Congress as an electioneering machine, fuelled no longer by the idealism of the freedom struggle but by pragmatism in politics, with the sole purpose of grabbing power and holding on to it at any cost. Despite Nehru’s sincere attempts to reverse the trend, the temptation to mix religion with politics never died down and became ingrained in the party. Ayodhya had now become vulnerable, and the stage had been set for the Ayodhya strategy.

---

> The origin of the Ramachabutara is linked inextricably to the Revolt of 1857. During the revolt, British life and property in Ayodhya and Faizabad were endangered and some landlords offered help to the British and ‘a similar offer was made by the mahants of Hanumangarhi’. Once the uprising was suppressed, those who had helped the British were suitably rewarded. This situation threw up an opportunity for the mahants of Ayodhya. Without much delay, one of them took over a part of the Babri Masjid compound and constructed a raised platform (chabutara) there. Right from the beginning, the local Muslims repeatedly opposed this attempt. On 30 November 1858, Maulvi Muhhamad Asghar, khateeb and muezzin of the Babri Masjid, submitted a petition to the magistrate complaining that the vairagis had built a chabutara close to the mosque. Similar complaints were made by local Muslims in 1860, 1877, 1883 and 1884. Mainly as a result of the attitude of the courts, the mahant of the janmasthan and his successors were forced to maintain the status quo within the compound of the Babri Masjid. All those years, the Ramachabutara remained a profoundly dilapidated place with a small makeshift wooden temple and a number of small idols kept in various crevices.

---

> In 1948-49, the district administration of Faizabad had got into a hectic exercise to break the status quo that had existed for almost six decades following judgments in the mid-1880s by district and provincial courts, strictly prohibiting vairagis from constructing any temple on the elevated platform. Two district officials were at the centre of this exercise. One was Deputy Commissioner-cum-District Magistrate K.K.K. Nair, Guru Datt Singh, the other district official involved in this exercise, was Nair’s fervent supporter. He was the city magistrate of Faizabad and acted as assistant to the deputy commissioner. They were later implicated in the affair as the leaders of the Hindu militants who had planted the idol in the Babri Masjid on the night of 22 December 1949. The official investigation that ensued concluded that Nair and Singh played such a flagrant role in the incident that they must be invited to retire to private life. Following this, K.K.K. Nair was forced to retire from his post together with his assistant Guru Datt Singh.
> 
>  Their plan was to reverse the six-decade-old status quo by obtaining permission from the state government to construct a grand temple on the chabutara and on nearby land. This, they thought, would eventually encompass the Babri Masjid. The trio of K.K.K. Nair, Gopal Singh Visharad and Guru Datt Singh worked hand-in-hand to achieve their common objective, drawing inspiration and taking instruction from Mahant Digvijai Nath, who was also pretty close to the mahants and vairagis of Ayodhya, including Abhiram Das, the man who later played the key role on the ground. In a way, therefore, Digvijai Nath was acting as the unifying factor for all those who wanted the Ayodhya strategy to succeed

---

> Just as days before the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, Mahasabha leaders like Digvijai Nath contributed greatly to poisoning the atmosphere, so also in Ayodhya, days before the beginning of the navah paath, there was a rapid rise in militant Hindu communalism which displayed utter disdain for the faith of the minority community, The clique became hyperactive as Rama Vivah approached. Armed with Hanumangarhi’s decision, the All India Ramayan Mahasabha launched a large-scale campaign to mobilize Hindus much ahead of the scheduled navah paath. Soon, the whole town of Ayodhya was in a state of panic and uproar.
> 
> All the signs of the storm were therefore evident much in advance, but no one in authority was willing to take note of them. And when, in the aftermath of the installation of the idol, the district magistrate, K.K.K. Nair, was asked as to why he did not take any preventive measures, his reply was simple: there was no indication of any such development. ‘It was an act of which there was no forewarning,’ Nair wrote to the chief secretary, Government of the United Provinces, on 26 December 1949, days after the statue was installed in the mosque.
> 
> Nair was obviously lying. His claim that he had no ‘forewarning’ and that even local Muslims never told him about the ‘move for installing an idol either forcibly or clandestinely’ was a desperate attempt to save his own neck. For much before the beginning of the navah paath, and more so after its commencement, everyone in Ayodhya sensed the combustible situation caused primarily by the activities of the All India Ramayan Mahasabha, and knew about the virtual takeover of the area around the Babri Masjid by vairagis, and the rumour that their ultimate objective was to instal the idol of Rama in the mosque. Moreover, as early as 9 November 1949, the local Muslims had sounded out Nair about it.

---

> After Kartik Purnima on 5 November, three Muslims went to see Babri Masjid. Some vairagis present there stopped them from entering the mosque. When they persisted, the vairagis started beating them. Immediately after this incident, some vairagis and sadhus started digging the graves that were there for long in front of the Babri Masjid. A small mosque, called Kanati Masjid, located to the south-east of Babri Masjid, was also razed to the ground and turned into a platform. Several havan kunds were created in places where graves were dug.
A report in *Aaj*, a local newspaper read "Mass meetings were held. Loudspeakers fitted in tongas [horse-drawn carts] and cars kept screaming day in and day out, calling upon the people to come for darshan in the mosque where yajna […] was taking place, as the place of Ram’s birth was being reclaimed." The Ramachabutara had become, for the first time in its history, the most talked-about place in Ayodhya.
>
> On 4 December 1949, the navah paath ended, but without being able to ‘persuade’ Lord Rama to leave the chabutara and ‘shift’ to his ‘original place of birth’ within the Babri Masjid. It was a big setback for the organizers. Many among the organizers had thought that someone from the crowd, led by the heightened passion, would break into the mosque and install an idol there. If not from the crowd, they had expected someone from their own ranks to play Nathuram Godse in this case too.
>
> Murmurs had begun and people had started saying that it was all a drama enacted for the sake of collecting offerings. It all seemed a crude joke. The resentment against the organizers of the navah paath was clearly visible. However, the leaders of the All India Ramayan Mahasabha – the acolytes of Mahant Digvijai Nath – were untroubled by these incendiary comments. At the behest of the organizers of the navah paath, a group of Ramanandi sadhus met K.K.K. Nair to discuss the ways to break the deadlock. Nair gave them the impression that he would provide all the possible help from behind the scenes if they planted the idol stealthily.

---
 
> It was decided that Abhiram Das and Paramhans, together with another vairagi – Vrindavan Das – would sneak into the Babri Masjid before midnight the next day (22 December 1949). The deadline was significant because that was the time when the duty of the guard – who had been persuaded to look the other way in the event of vairagis trying to sneak into the mosque – was to end at the gate of the Babri Masjid. Once inside the mosque, they were to lie low till around four in the morning, after which they were to light a lamp, chant mantras and beat the ghanta-ghariyal as loudly as they could. Gopal Singh Visharad was given the responsibility of mobilizing Hindu devotees in large numbers – from Ayodhya as well as from nearby villages and townships – the very next morning and to arouse a lot of passion so that the local administration, even if under pressure from higher authorities, could fall back on the argument that the use of force might lead to large-scale loss of life and property.
>
> Recounted Indushekhar Jha: Abhiram Das sat just beneath the central dome of [the] Babri Masjid firmly holding the idol in his hands and we got active. We threw away all the articles [of previous possessors], including their urns, mats as well as clothes and utensils of the muezzin. We then erased many Islamic carvings with the help of a khurpi [a sharp-edged instrument generally used for gardening purposes] from the inner and outer walls of the mosque, and scribbled Sita and Rama in saffron and yellow colours on them. Around four in the morning, while it was still pitch dark, the intruders, following the script finalized in Jambwant Quila the day before, lit the lamp and started doing aarti.

---

> The district magistrate of Faizabad was among the first to reach the spot once Abhiram Das finished the operation successfully in the dead of the night. At that time the masjid only had a handful of people and Ayodhya was asleep. No one would have known about the incident – or people would have come to know so late that no commotion would have been possible – had the district magistrate acted swiftly and removed the idol and images of Hindu deities from the mosque and scratched away the writings, not many in number, from its inner and outer walls. So, he could have easily restored the mosque’s status quo ante without creating any fuss among Hindu believers. That was also expected of any district magistrate anywhere in the country. But it was not a normal situation, and the district magistrate of Faizabad was not acting innocently; he was more interested complicating the problem than resolving it. It was for this reason that the FIR of the incident was lodged only at nine in the morning though Nair had reached the spot at five.
> 
> K.K.K. Nair, together with his assistant Guru Datt Singh, had also been trying hard to push the crisis into a legal impasse so that there would be a legal bar on removing the idol from the mosque. Getting a property declared disputed and attaching it under Section 145 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), 1898, was not very difficult for district magistrates those days. Nair could easily have done that with the help of his subordinates in the local administration. The only issue, therefore, was identifying an amenable person for the post of the receiver for this attached property. It was for this purpose that Nair and Singh sought help from Babu Priyadatta Ram, the chairman of the Faizabad-cum-Ayodhya Municipal Board. Being the third generation of his family to lead the Kayastha Party, a strong caste party in Faizabad, he commanded a wide local network which could be deployed deftly at the service of K.K.K. Nair and Hindu communalists.

---

> Nair once again shifted his attention towards Lucknow, this time to scuttle the state government’s proposed move to get the idol removed from the Babri Masjid. On 27 December 1949, a day after his first letter, he shot off a second one to Bhagwan Sahay, the chief secretary of the UP government. This letter, written in response to Faizabad commissioner Shyam Sundarlal Dar’s order to remove the idol from the mosque, was much bolder than the previous one, and Nair, confident of settling the issue in favour of Hindu communalists, refused to carry out the order, arguing that it would rekindle communal violence: The Commissioner returned from Lucknow and gave me and the Superintendent [of] Police the outline of a scheme for removing the idol from the mosque surreptitiously to janmabhumi temple outside the mosque.
>
>With Lucknow not acting to carry out its resolve to restore the mosque to Muslims, Priyadatta Ram took charge of the disputed property on 5 January 1950 and submitted to the district magistrate a scheme of arrangements necessary for the upkeep and worship of the idol installed in the mosque. The proceedings under Section 145 of the CrPC, 1898, were drawn up suo motu by Magistrate Markandey Singh, and a preliminary order was issued on 29 December 1949 attaching the Babri Masjid and appointing Babu Priyadatta Ram as its receiver. Nair had succeeded. The mosque had been turned into a temple.

---

> In 1952, Nair’s wife became a member of Parliament from Gonda on an All India Hindu Mahasabha ticket and, in 1967, Nair himself won a Lok Sabha election from Bahraich on a ticket from the Jana Sangh, an offshoot of the Mahasabha. Guru Datt Singh also entered politics and continued to play a prominent role in the communal politics of Faizabad for some time. 

---

> As K.K.K. Nair sought to bluff Lucknow, the premier of the province, Govind Ballabh Pant, did not do better in his dealings with the Centre, particularly Jawaharlal Nehru. Precious time was lost in the name of ‘exploring all avenues’ and soon it was too late. Despite Govind Ballabh Pant’s repeated assurances that efforts were being made to set things right, nothing seemed to be happening on the ground. For Nehru, the developments in Ayodhya were a matter of grave concern and he offered, if necessary, to go to Ayodhya himself. Pant, however, dissuaded Nehru from proceeding to Ayodhya, assuring him that K.K.K. Nair and Guru Datt Singh had been replaced and that he was expecting some satisfactory solution to be found and the idol of Rama removed peacefully. It was obvious that Pant was playing his own politics on the issue. He himself had set the communal tone during the by-elections of 1948 and his protégé, Baba Raghav Das, was openly issuing threats that he would resign from the Legislative Assembly if the idol was removed from the mosque. Pant was, at the same time, aware that Nehru could not do much so long as he (Pant) enjoyed the confidence of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a supporter of Hindu chauvinism in the Congress. Thus, even though Patel – the home minister and deputy prime minister of India – wrote to Pant to find a peaceful solution to the Ayodhya problem, on no occasion did his tone develop an edge against the premier of UP.
> 
> Nehru had, however, begun to suspect the intentions of Pant. His delaying tactics and his dilly-dallying on restoring the occupancy of the Babri Masjid left Nehru utterly frustrated. Moreover, Pant’s casual approach towards this crucial issue left no doubt in Nehru’s mind that Pant was more determined to keep the problem in Ayodhya alive.

---

> The Ayodhya development was significant not just because of the capture of the mosque, but also due to the Mahasabha’s successful deployment of a large number of Hindus, for several days, on as communal an issue as converting a mosque into a temple. Ayodhya represented a local climax, but that had to be magnified enormously. The Hindu Mahasabha had taken a huge leap. The party that had been almost fully immobilized following the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi seemed to have suddenly stood up with a firm resolve and, during its annual conference, it decided to stage a political comeback. On 25 December 1949, on the second day of the three-day conference, the newly elected president of the Hindu Mahasabha, N.B. Khare, announced that the party was ‘now re-entering the field of politics with the ideology of a cultural state of Hindu Rashtra after a temporary suspension of its political activities’.
> 
> N.B. Khare’s strange understanding of Indian culture led him to arrive at dangerous conclusions: *'It is my firm belief that to solve the problem of this nation there should be a change of constitution. Muslims should be regarded as second class citizens. They should be allowed freedom of movement everywhere. They should be permitted to enter trade or commerce; practice [sic] their culture; their money, property should be protected. But they should stay away from politics. They should not be permitted any part in the political life of the country. That change should be made in the constitution. Unless that is done, this country cannot progress. This will always be a land of conflict.'*

---

> The day of V.G. Deshpande’s visit to Ayodhya was a crucial one in the implementation of the Mahasabha’s game plan. For it was on 16 January that the party made the first serious move to consolidate its gains of 22 December 1949, both legally and politically. Gopal Singh Visharad. All through the day, this central figure of the local party unit remained occupied in filing a suit in the civil court of Faizabad, seeking the issue of an order allowing him the right to worship the deity installed in the masjid while restraining the defendants from removing the idol. Acting on the suit, the civil judge directed the issue of a notice to the defendants, and in the meantime ordered, on the same day, the issue of an interim injunction as requested. The interim injunction that Visharad obtained from the civil court was to become the bedrock upon which the politics of independent India would be turned around in the years to come.

---

> On 18 January, immediately after reaching Varanasi, Deshpande wrote a long letter to R.A. Kanitkar, the office secretary at the Hindu Mahasabha headquarters in New Delhi, and gave him proper instructions on how to go about converting the Ayodhya issue into a plank for the nationwide mobilization of Hindus. Based on this letter, the head office of the Mahasabha issued a circular to all its party units to observe 27 March 1950, the festival celebrating the birth of Lord Rama, called Rama Navami, as ‘Rama Janmabhoomi Day’.
>
> Interestingly, neither in the circular nor in the personal note of Deshpande did the Mahasabha utter a single word on what had happened on the night of 22 December 1949. Hiding this crucial fact was a shrewd political device to whip up passion on the basis of distorted information. On the face of it, the objective was to foil all attempts to displace the idol from the Babri Masjid, but mixed with that was the opportunity to reap huge political dividends from the campaign.

> Though the founder of the Arya Samaj, Dayanand Saraswati, was not a proponent of Hindu nationalism, and its members, up to the beginning of the twentieth century, viewed Hinduism as a degraded form of the Vedic religion, the ideological characteristics of this socio-religious organization were such that it became the crucible of Hindu nationalism in the last two to three decades of colonial rule. It, therefore, did not take much time for the Arya Samaj in Ayodhya to align itself with the Hindu Mahasabha once the latter raised the communal pitch.

---

> the question of control over the new janmabhoomi inside the Babri Masjid – which had eclipsed the old one at the chabutara – had begun to be fiercely debated among vairagis. All through, the Ramachabutara, the janmabhoomi till not too long ago, had remained under the control of the Nirmohi Akhara, but the installation of the Rama idol had been spearheaded by Abhiram Das, a vairagi belonging to the Nirvani Akhara. So, the infighting between the prominent akharas of the Ramanandi sect began as soon as it appeared the government had been forced to desist from removing the idol from the mosque. Control over janmabhoomi meant control over all the offerings and donations that poured in. Neither akhara, therefore, wanted to give up its claim.
> 
> Several years after K.K.K. Nair was relieved of his government job on 14 March 1950 – by which time he had established himself as a lawyer and shifted his residence to Lucknow – he told his attorney, Sadhu Saran Mishra, who looked after his property-related cases in the civil court of Faizabad, that there indeed had been ‘proper planning’ in which he and Guru Datt Singh played the role of ‘initiators’ while ‘Thakur’ Bir Singh, the civil judge of Faizabad, was the ‘collaborator’. It is also true that these civil servants and innumerable Hindu communalists could not have succeeded in their mission, and the illegal possession of the mosque would have been reversed had the local judiciary acted differently.
> 
> The manner in which Section 145 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 1898 was interpreted leaves only one impression – that the Babri Masjid fell victim to not just a political conspiracy but a judicial one as well. Nair’s claim of judge Bir Singh playing the role of a ‘collaborator’, despite the latter’s insistence on doing the ‘entire thing’ under the ‘limits of the law’, therefore, assumes immense significance. Section 145 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 1898 was used not to reverse the act of wrongful dispossession but rather to sanctify it. Section 145 empowers the magistrate to ask the parties to file their claims, not on the title to the property, but ‘as respects the fact of actual possession of the subject of dispute’. The magistrate decides ‘which of the parties was’ in possession. If a party has been ‘forcibly or wrongfully dispossessed’, the magistrate may treat it as if it had been in possession. It is then restored in possession, leaving it to the aggressor to file a civil suit to establish his title to the property.

---

> February 1950, the case had taken a different turn. This became possible simply because Section 145 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 1898 was used not to reverse the act of wrongful dispossession but rather to sanctify it. Section 145 empowers the magistrate to ask the parties to file their claims, not on the title to the property, but ‘as respects the fact of actual possession of the subject of dispute’. The magistrate decides ‘which of the parties was’ in possession. If a party has been ‘forcibly or wrongfully dispossessed’, the magistrate may treat it as if it had been in possession. It is then restored in possession, leaving it to the aggressor to file a civil suit to establish his title to the property. This crucial aspect of Section 145 was deliberately ignored during the course of the proceedings drawn up suo motu by Magistrate Markandey Singh. The subversion of this law began on 29 December 1949 when a preliminary order was issued attaching the mosque and appointing the chairman of the municipal board of Faizabad-cum-Ayodhya, Babu Priyadatta Ram, as its receiver.
> 
> Priyadatta Ram assumed charge on 5 January 1950. The scheme that he proposed to Nair for the management of ‘the premises in dispute’ turned Section 145 upside down. The district magistrate promptly approved the scheme of management submitted by Priyadatta Ram. Thus, the mosque was turned into a temple and placed in the custody of the municipality, and the litigation was allowed to take its course. The spirit of Section 145 was killed, and the Babri Masjid declared a ‘property in dispute’ which was likely to ‘lead to a breach of the peace’. The party that had been dispossessed on 22–23 December 1949 was completely excluded, and the mosque was allowed to pass into the hands of Hindu communalist mobs.
> 
> Weeks later, the civil judge of Faizabad, Bir Singh, did not have any need to cross the ‘limits of the law’. Acting on a petition filed by Gopal Singh Visharad, he issued an injunction – first on 16 January and then on 19 January 1950 – restraining the removal of the idol from the Babri Masjid and anyone from interfering with the puja carried on therein since 23 December 1949. No one from among the dispossessed came forward to resist it, just as no one from their side had come forward to file an FIR. No one asked why none among the Muslims came out to stake the community’s claim over their place of worship, for no one could claim that the answer was still unknown, or that fear was not all-pervasive in the community.

---

> K .K.K. Nair presided over Faizabad for nine months and fourteen days, from 1 June 1949 till 14 March 1950 when he was relieved of his job, and in that short period, he made a huge impression – most of them through a series of conspiracies – in the district. The mutilation of the mosque was just one testimony to his conspiracies; almost all others involved his insatiable appetite for amassing huge chunks of land in and around Faizabad for himself.
>
> Like a true communalist, to whom religion matters only so long as it can be used for non-religious and highly selfish purposes, Nair did not hesitate to grab even the land donated in the name of God. In this, opium became his weapon and the Ranopali Nanakshahi Temple – one of the oldest temples of the Udaseen sect – his victim. In 1949, the Ranopali Nanakshahi Temple controlled huge tracts of fertile agricultural land that was acquired mostly through donations from the nawabs of Awadh. In the late 1940s, Mahant Keshav Das began taking opium and soon became an addict. As the drug was not available readily, he was always on the lookout for it. Partly due to this lack of regular supply of the drug, Keshav Das walked into a trap laid for him by K.K.K. Nair. The mahant’s addiction was an opportunity Nair exploited to rob the Udaseen sect of its possessions in Ayodhya and nearby areas. By this time, however, the land ceiling law was in place, and it rendered Nair’s victory meaningless. His landholdings as well as those of his family members had already crossed the statutory ceiling. He decided to return the land to the Udaseen sect if the latter paid him the expenditure that he had incurred on the case. The issue was thus resolved. 
> 
> Close on the heels of the ‘miracle’ in the Babri Masjid, real estate gifts started pouring in for Nair. Among the most notable was a massive mango orchard, euphemistically called Lakhperwa Bagh. The name was derived from the fact that it had one lakh trees. Providing Nair with huge tracts of land was primarily because this was seen by the Mahasabhaites and vairagis as a way to return the favour done to them by the former district magistrate of Faizabad.
>
> Nair was not the sole beneficiary of these efforts. Some of his close associates too benefited from them, one such being Gopal Singh Visharad.
>
> This was also the period when these landlords were being crushed under the pressure of accumulated taxes which were due to the province. This situation led the government to bring, just before the abolition of the zamindari system, an Encumbered Estates Act, which empowered the government to acquire the properties of defaulters. Nair sensed an opportunity for himself in this. In lieu of clearing government dues, he began acquiring huge plots held by different estates in the region. One of the biggest properties he acquired thus belonged originally to the Lorpur Estate. Called Lorpur House, it was situated in the midst of a sprawling campus in the Civil Lines area of Faizabad. For some time it remained Nair’s residence and was later sold off as small residential plots, giving rise to what is now known as ‘Nair Colony’ in the heart of the city. Similar cases were reported from Santhari village, Tikri in Gonda District and in the Palia Shahbadi area close to Civil Lines in Faizabad.

> The man who understood K.K.K. Nair the best, Akshay Brahmachari, was also the one who first comprehended the ominous design behind the Ayodhya strategy of the Hindu Mahasabha. Communalists, who roamed the streets of Ayodhya without any fear, started calling him an ‘Islamophile’ and the ‘real trouble maker’, and within days, Brahmachari was forced to leave Ayodhya. But this only strengthened Brahmachari’s resolve to fight against the crime. For he knew that what was happening in Ayodhya had nothing to do with the religious or historical beliefs of any community but was part of a larger political design, and that if the crime went unpunished, the perpetrators would be emboldened and use yet another issue to whip up communal passion.

>"Those who want to compromise today with the people trying to finish off Muslims should also be ready for the fact that tomorrow these very people, in order to promote their fascist politics, would behave similarly with Harijans and day after tomorrow with Sikhs and four days later the country would get fragmented into Vaishnav area, Shaiv area and many such pockets. And all this would lead to chaos and Hitler’s brand of terrorism which will destroy the democracy," said Aksay Bhramachary.

> The Mahasabha could not sustain for long the communalist propaganda that it started immediately after taking over the mosque, and the gains the party had made in the first few months after 22 December 1949 started vanishing. One of the reasons for the Mahasabha’s inability to do so was that, once the Constitution was adopted on 26 January 1950, secularism became one of the pillars of independent India. As the trauma started healing, the mood of the nation started changing. The Mahasabha had badly misjudged Nehru’s ability to outmanoeuvre communalists.

> The post-Partition context had given the Mahasabhaites hope that they could exploit the situation arising from the trauma of Partition – a hope that was quashed in the aftermath of Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination. But later, their successful collaboration with Congress traditionalists in Ayodhya revived this hope. To Nehru’s further dismay, this partnership was not just restricted to Ayodhya and UP, but had started showing up on higher planes as well. Many Congress members seemed to agree with the views of Syama Prasad Mookerjee, arguably the most articulate voice of Hindu communalists in the Parliament, and Purushottamdas Tandon, the Congress heavyweight in UP who symbolized the communal outlook of a section of the party. Congressmen belonging to this school of thought want to see the end of the policy of appeasement of Pakistan by Congress, which, they say, has continued even after [the] partition of the country.
>
> These developments were significant from the point of view of the way they were contributing to intra-party power struggles in the Congress which had started once the idealism of the freedom struggle ceased to remain a viable constraint on political venality and with Mahatma Gandhi no longer around to broker peace. In particular, the Congress members in favour of employing closet communalism for political ends were strengthening the efforts by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and his faction of Hindu conservatives to neutralize Nehru. While Patel had taken vigorous action against the RSS and the Hindu Mahasabha following the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, he did not hesitate to press for some recognition of Hinduism in India’s national life. In fact, one of the arguments used in Mahasabha circles against the resumption of political activity in 1949 was that it was not necessary since Sardar Patel was pursuing a strong Hindu policy.
>
> Patel was pushing the name of Purushottamdas Tandon for the post of party president. Purushottamdas Tandon was the person chiefly responsible for creating an atmosphere in UP which made closet communalism a credible tactic. The secret of his popularity was as much due to his powerful rapport with the masses through his long association with the agrarian movements of the 1920s and ’30s as his fanatic dedication to the causes dearest to conservative Congress members and communalists – Hindi, Hindus and Hinduism. 
>
> Patel had his own calculations. His recognition of positive qualities in the proponents of Hindu Rashtra seems to have been based on his hope, rather anticipation, that their incorporation in the Congress would soften their extremist tendencies and, once their ideology became diluted, remove a current of militant opposition which could then be a source of strength for his own faction within the Congress.

> At the Congress session at Nasik in September 1950, just when Nehru seemed to be losing hold over the party, he came out of his shock and depression, and hit back with full force on the issue of communalist ideas penetrating a party that was founded on secular ideals. Nehru regained the allegiance of many Congress members, and all the resolutions he proposed were passed. The death of Patel on 15 December 1950 accelerated the process further. It deprived Tandon of a vital ally and spread desolation throughout the Hindu communalist camp.
> 
> The war thus won led Nehru to impose a style of politics based on secularism – a style that had no space for communal politics of the Hindu Mahasabha. The fate of the Ayodhya strategy too was sealed now. In every part of the country, including UP, communalist politics suffered from the way Nehru contested its legitimacy and repressed its propagandist activities.
> 
> There is a counter-argument as well, which raises some pertinent questions. Was it necessary for Nehru to remain a mute spectator while Govind Ballabh Pant and Purushottamdas Tandon played the communal card to finish off their opponents in UP? Would communalists still have succeeded in taking over the Babri Masjid and retaining it in the face of all the hue and cry, had Nehru opted for an uncompromisingly tough attitude towards them right from the beginning? Wouldn’t a harder attitude have forced the state government to take effective steps to remove the idol from the mosque and, thereby, undo the wrong committed on the night of 22 December 1949? Could the Hindu Mahasabha have succeeded in going that far in implementing its Ayodhya strategy without Nehru’s soft approach? Equally debatable is the amount of power Nehru actually possessed between 1947 and 1950, as well as the extent of his determination to use it to protect his potential intra-party allies.

---

> At the local level, too, the Mahasabha’s plan started withering away as soon as the focus in Ayodhya shifted from capturing the Babri Masjid to sharing the booty. And it happened around the same time when Nehru was imposing constraints on any strategy of ethno-religious mobilization in the country. Avarice killed the unity among the various groups of communalists which were supposed to be the bedrock upon which the Hindu Mahasabha would have propelled its Ayodhya strategy.
>
> The Ayodhya Strategy did not bear fruit for Hindu communalists immediately, but the night of 22–23 December 1949 set in motion a chain of events which were to give rise to one of the most contentious issues in independent India.

---

> The situation started changing once the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), an offshoot of the RSS, began a campaign to build a Rama Temple in Ayodhya in 1984. The Babri Masjid– Ramajanmabhoomi dispute took centre stage in February 1986 when the district court of Faizabad ordered the unlocking of the mosque and allowing the worship of the idol by devotees. In 1989, as the issue started becoming increasingly contentious, all the title suits were consolidated and transferred to the Allahabad High Court so that they could be taken up together.

---

> The rath yatra of LK Advani – one of the leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the political arm of the RSS – aimed at arousing Hindu sentiments in support of a Rama temple in Ayodhya in September–October 1990 further worsened the situation. In October 1992, the VHP announced the resumption of kar seva on 6 December 1992. The frenzy of the mob that converged on the Babri Masjid on that day saw the mosque being attacked and demolished. The BJP, gaining strength after making this issue the central point of its politics, reaped dividends in 1998.
>
> The VHP now set a fresh deadline of 15 March 2002 to begin the construction of a temple for Lord Rama. Once again, kar sevaks from all over the country started converging in Ayodhya. It was while returning from one such trip by a group of kar sevaks that a coach of the Sabarmati Express was burnt down at Godhra, in Gujarat, followed by one of the worst pogroms India has ever seen after Independence.
