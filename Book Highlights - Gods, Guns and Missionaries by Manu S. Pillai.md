#### Monsters And Missionaries
##### Chapter Summary: 

This chapter tries to understand the initial arrival of Christian missionaries to India and how they tried to wrap their heads around the complexities of Hindu society. Europeans, familiar with a structured template, try to box Hindus and their religion into a similar template, but having failed to do so, resort to constructed clichés and fear-mongering in an attempt to make themselves feel better while ensuring the exaggerated reports help them get the necessary funding from their patrons back at home. The Portuguese arrival and their subsequent attempts at conversion through force fail spectacularly, and the newer Jesuits then, realising that there is more to Hinduism than the 'savage' stories that they have been fed with, try to make Christianity more palatable to Indians by importing several Hindu practices, such as caste and scriptures, into a Christian style, and thereby succeed in getting a good number of converts, notably through the efforts of Jesuits like Robert De Nobili, the 'Italian Brahmin.'

This period might also be considered as one that gave the initial impetus to 'Hindu nationalism,' where the Hindus see how the foreigner looks and tries to understand Hindu practices and customs, and, unable to understand the context behind them, labels these as 'barbaric' and tries to introduce his brand of 'civilisation.'. The coercion and aggressive methods employed to do this probably made the locals look at themselves as being 'suppressed' and tried to compensate for this by countering with their own aggressive pushbacks.

##### Highlights:
For few Europeans had direct experience of the topics they described, with the result that unchristian subjects were pressed into ready-made, more familiar Christian templates. As multi-armed, many-headed Hindu deities were heard of, these too were retrofitted into available medieval categories. Or as Mitter tells, ‘classical monsters and [pagan] gods, Biblical demons and Indian gods were all lumped together’ in one universal master class: that of ‘monsters’. Received (un)wisdom of this variety was to go a long way in framing India and its culture in the West now. Sati, limited to certain classes and places,  was identified as a defining feature of Hinduism. Additionally, given that such travelogues were sparse in number, each possessed the capital to launch stereotypes. Overzealousness—became the latest staple in travel diaries, its horror inspiring a heap of supposed eyewitness accounts. From the end of the medieval times, down to the colonial age, then, there was an information network that duplicated certain clichés about India and Hindus, helping Europeans construct a self-image of themselves as better.

As for the Hindus, at first India’s residents could not have cared for what itinerant Europeans were writing about them, their gods and culture. But as the white man’s political power grew in the country, his skewed narratives—and the prejudice these came to represent—acquired the ability to afflict their world. And so, these would slowly become a threat, till in time Hindus themselves were forced to answer the question: Who were they, really? If not devil-worshippers, what was their religion truly about? In a world where other (unfriendly) cultures could scrutinize their identity, how might they articulate their self-image? It was in the construction of these answers that Hinduism took its contemporary, modern form, drawing pride and confidence from certain aspects of its past and shame from others.

---
The story of Hindus’ life under Western authority begins in 1498. In May that year, Portuguese sailors landed in Kerala on the Indian coast. Portugal’s elite and royalty were propelling the venture: Unlike traders, incentivized to keep their heads down, minimize risks and turn profits, these aristocratic backers hoped to acquire that extra commodity called glory. They had ‘the gun in [their] hand and’, they were certain, ‘god on [their] side’, all this stemming from a religious fervour inflecting politics in their own part of the world.

It helped that inland powers in India took little interest in maritime affairs, allowing the Portuguese to militarize international waters. Armed aggression in disrupting pre-existing networks also turned them into predatory extortionists. With the establishment of a white ruling class in their tracts, the Portuguese came into everyday contact with Hindus, armed with scarce knowledge but copious pre-judgement. With the emerging Protestant movement accusing the Catholic church of perverting the faith, Catholic powers had a special necessity to demonstrate unequivocal Christian credentials. And here, their newly acquired Indian enclaves offered a parade ground, packed as they were with devil-worshipping pagans.

---
local Hindu elites had aided the Europeans in taking Goa from its previous (Muslim) masters.  They would regret this, though, for no sooner were their new rulers secure than they proved worse than the last regime. In 1540–41, hundreds of temples were razed, their assets appropriated for Christian institutions. 

---
Hindu princes tended to wrest deities; non-Hindu powers threatened their destruction. So, new strategies were invented: Some gods were hidden behind walls, others in ponds; occasionally decoy gods were planted to mislead. Why, certain Hindu deities were secreted away disguised as corpses. Something similar transpired in Goa now, as gods looked for sanctuaries from white tyranny. Temples, after all, were being ‘demolished stone by stone’, the deities within ‘burnt’, ‘beaten into pulp’ or, if they were metal, melted for reuse as church objects and chandeliers. The Portuguese had to demonstrate with fire and blood that they were authentic Christians. 132 And Hindus suffered in the process.

---
Kerala was home to the Nasranis, who claimed descent from converts left by the apostle St Thomas in 52 CE. They performed similar rituals as Hindus, had notions of caste purity, and maintained links with temples—a syncretism which to Europeans was scandal. At first, they sought to shepherd Nasranis into the Catholic fold through persuasion. In 1599, after their Persian bishop died, the community was coerced into accepting Catholic suzerainty. It divided Kerala’s Christians but enough in the community clung to the old ways: The cock sacrifices continued, as did traditions in which figures like St George are cast as siblings to fiery goddesses like Kali.

---
In all this, the nascent beginnings of something powerful is visible. Among Hindus, persecution by an alien race wielding a foreign faith would, at one level, spark a soul-searching of sorts. It was clear to most in Goa that what the Portuguese were doing was not merely politics; religion was enmeshed in it. not all Hindus were prepared to submit to this ‘catechism through fear’.  Herein lies the impulse that would mark political Hinduism. 

---
Life in Goa was tough, with employment, political status and much else made contingent on Christianization. There were creative strategies also to bypass the imbalance in power. Parking gods just miles outside Goa’s limits, for instance, Hindus wooed converts, encouraging apostasy. Brahmins manufactured rites to re -convert lapsed Hindus: You could bathe in the sea or wash yourself with Ganga water. Shrines outside Goa where exiled deities now resided were often grander than their original seats, in visual defiance of the Portuguese. In the end, the government relaxed its grip, not least because its policies had proved bad for business. Many deities returned to Goa, and Catholics and Hindus began sharing festivals, Christian saints receiving veneration from the latter, 169 and Hindu goddesses winning Catholic devotees.

---
Local culture, it would seem, ultimately triumphed over decrees of the foreigner. But for future Hindu nationalists this was exactly it—Hindus, they would argue, were naively large-hearted. Alien faiths, on the other hand, with the slightest power in so small a quarter as Goa, tended towards aggression. Hindus, it would be lamented, were habitually prepared to forgive the worst horrors; tolerance on their rivals’ part, however, was based only on practical calculations. Old patterns, therefore, would no longer do. To prevent old horrors from recurring, they could neither forgive nor forget. And memories of persecution—and resistance—would one day supply the raw material for articulating a unified, combative Hinduism; one aspiring not only to defend itself but of actively going on the offensive.

---
In Tamil country, there were thirty villages of Paravar converted around the 1530s, but this was not because Jesus appealed to this low-ranking group of fishermen, and boat- and salt-makers. Facing competition from rivals in the pearl-fishing sector, the Paravar had sought Portuguese security and were claimed wholesale in a quid pro quo—a commercial rather than spiritual transaction.

---
For missionaries, this more sophisticated glimpse of Hindu ideas generated a problem, for they could no longer simply traffic in stereotypes. They would, instead, have to apply themselves to gathering real knowledge before they could debunk the Hindu system. This was not simple polytheism—if there was a variety of gods in shrines, these were all ‘under’ a formless great being.

---
Thomas Stephens, composed the *Kristapurana* (‘Christ Purana’) in a blend of the Marathi and Konkani languages. Instead of inflicting Latin alone and patronizing lectures, the man crafted a vehicle for Christian ideas, imitating Hindu devotional poetry. Where Europeans so far clumsily pushed Eastern concepts into Western moulds—and damned them for not fitting—they now attempted the reverse, veiling imported spiritual cargo in ‘native’ fabric.

---
Catholics were linked too closely with the Portuguese, who, to Hindu elites, lacked dignity. The Parangi (a corruption of ‘Frank’, for Europeans) was pegged with drinking, rowdiness (thanks to sailors), inferior castes (like the fishermen Xavier converted). And it was true that, outside Goa, most converts were of lower caste; a reason why even the Nasranis hesitated to adopt Catholicism.

---
Robert de Nobili, an Italian Jesuit, turned his gaze to the cream of Hindu society. For if they were wooed, prestige would encase Christianity. It was critical, that is, to aim high and pluck from the top. He embraced their sartorial tastes, dressing hereon like a sanyasi in saffron robes. He even restyled the Christian message—he spoke not of the Parangi Margam but *Satya Vedam* (‘true religion’), with himself as *tattvabodhakar* (‘teacher of truth’). By 1610, his Jesuit bosses in Goa learnt that he had acquired a sacred thread, worn by Brahmins across the torso, and that he no longer ate meat. So much so that many believed he was preaching a new religion. De Nobili even invented new rites: When a Brahmin came on, he cut his old sacred thread, and gave him a ‘Christian’ one with a cross. Like Hindus, Madurai’s new Catholics continued to apply sandalwood paste to the foreheads, and before mass, the father performed puja, or worship as in temples. After all, he wrote, ‘I professed to be an Italian Brahmin’.

---
At a time when the church had closed ranks to battle the Reformation in Europe, de Nobili was skating alarmingly close to inventing a brand-new headache. In 1612, they asked him not to separate his high-caste Christians from those ‘reeking with the stench of fish’ serviced by his partner; that all Christians must pray together was not negotiable. The Italian obeyed the letter of the command but violated its spirit by seating converts in separate rows by caste. By the time of his death in 1656, the Madurai mission commanded the loyalty of thousands. There were, unfortunately, not many Brahmins, but other high-born groups were attracted. To his naysayers, then, the Italian Brahmin’s success was its own answer. Inculturation grew so strong that when in 1744 Rome withdrew support, it was simply too late—Tamil Catholics were not amenable to European micromanagement. Their faith, while theologically distinct from that of Hindus, shared a ‘common religious idiom’—it had ensconced itself into a Hindu terrain.

---
Essentially, then, Christianity was altered. The Portuguese attacked Nasranis for appearing too Hindu; ironically now, their Catholic faith was succumbing to the same influences. Its greatest proof was the centrality of caste to ‘native’ Christians. Hinduism did not absorb Christianity as it once had tribal cults. Meanwhile, the latter, for its part, while staying separate, maintained a ‘native’ appearance, not posing as pointed a threat as the church in Goa. Christian saints simply joined a general cast of gods and goddesses in these parts.

---
For future Hindu nationalists , though, there was cause for worry, nevertheless. On the one hand, it was clear that political power made all the difference. Goa’s Christianization and demographic transformation, after all, was a result of Portuguese control of the state. The lesson, then, was that Hindus must always retain a grip over authority. But the Madurai (Tamil Catholic) formula was no better. The irony, of course, is that this strategy—of much acceptance with some rejection—was how Brahmins too planted their ideas across the subcontinent over the centuries, synthesizing countless groups and tribes into the Hindu order. Viewed this way, de Nobili was following an Indian tradition; the white Brahmin was, inadvertently, enacting the brown one’s playbook.
