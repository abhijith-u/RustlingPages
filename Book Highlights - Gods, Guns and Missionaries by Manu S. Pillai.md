MONSTERS AND MISSIONARIES

> For few Europeans had direct experience of the topics they described, with the result that unChristian subjects were pressed into ready-made, more familiar Christian templates. As multi-armed, many-headed Hindu deities were heard of, these too were retrofitted into available medieval categories. Or as Mitter tells, ‘classical monsters and [pagan] gods, Biblical demons and Indian gods were all lumped together’ in one universal master class: that of ‘monsters’. Received (un)wisdom of this variety was to go a long way in framing India and its culture in the West now. Sati quickly became an essential ingredient in travelogues, down to the British era, with the consequence that a real but hardly national custom, limited to certain classes and places,  was identified as a defining feature of Hinduism—a rhetorical handle that in time justified the British Raj’s own quest to ‘civilize’ India. Additionally, given that such travelogues were sparse in number, each possessed the capital to launch stereotypes.

---
At this time, these processions were associated with unnamed southern shrines, but by the British era, the ritual came specifically to revolve around the temple at Puri in Orissa, inspiring a hundred missionary pamphlets lambasting the savagery of Hindu idolatry.
---
From the end of the medieval times, down to the colonial age, then, there was an information network that duplicated certain clichés about India and Hindus, helping Europeans construct a self-image of themselves as better.
---
As for the Hindus, at first India’s residents could not have cared for what itinerant Europeans were writing about them, their gods and culture. But as the white man’s political power grew in the country, his skewed narratives—and the prejudice these came to represent—acquired the ability to afflict their world. And so, these would slowly become a threat, till in time Hindus themselves were forced to answer the question: Who were they, really? If not devil-worshippers, what was their religion truly about? In a world where other (unfriendly) cultures could scrutinize their identity, how might they articulate their self-image? It was in the construction of these answers that Hinduism took its contemporary, modern form, drawing pride and confidence from certain aspects of its past and shame from others.
---
The story of Hindus’ life under Western authority begins in 1498. In May that year, after many months at sea, a group of half-starved, exhausted Portuguese sailors landed in Kerala on the Indian coast.
---
Portugal’s elite and royalty were propelling the venture: Unlike traders, incentivized to keep their heads down, minimize risks and turn profits, these aristocratic backers hoped to acquire that extra commodity called glory. 96 They had ‘the gun in [their] hand and’, they were certain, ‘god on [their] side’, all this stemming from a religious fervour inflecting politics in their own part of the world.
---
helped that inland powers in India took little interest in maritime affairs, allowing the Portuguese to militarize international waters. Armed aggression in disrupting pre-existing networks also turned them into predatory extortionists.
---
With the establishment of a white ruling class in their tracts, the Portuguese came into everyday contact with Hindus, armed with scarce knowledge but copious pre-judgement.
---
with the emerging Protestant movement accusing the Catholic church of perverting the faith, Catholic powers had a special necessity to demonstrate unequivocal Christian credentials. And here, their newly acquired Indian enclaves offered a parade ground, packed as they were with devil-worshipping pagans.
---
local Hindu elites had aided the Europeans in taking Goa from its previous (Muslim) masters. 105 They would regret this, though, for no sooner were their new rulers secure than they proved worse than the last regime. In 1540–41, hundreds of temples were razed, their assets appropriated for Christian institutions.
---
Hindu princes tended to wrest deities; non-Hindu powers threatened their destruction.
---
So, new strategies were invented: Some gods were hidden behind walls, others in ponds; occasionally decoy gods were planted to mislead. Why, certain Hindu deities were secreted away disguised as corpses.
---
Something similar transpired in Goa now, as gods looked for sanctuaries from white tyranny. Temples, after all, were being ‘demolished stone by stone’, the deities within ‘burnt’, ‘beaten into pulp’ or, if they were metal, melted for reuse as church objects and chandeliers.
---
the Portuguese had to demonstrate with fire and blood that they were authentic Christians. 132 And Hindus suffered in the process.
---
Kerala was home to the Nasranis, who claimed descent from converts left by the apostle St Thomas in 52 CE .
---
they performed similar rituals as Hindus, had notions of caste purity, and maintained links with temples—a syncretism which to Europeans was scandal.
---
At first, they sought to shepherd Nasranis into the Catholic fold through persuasion,
---
In 1599, after their Persian bishop died, the community was coerced into accepting Catholic suzerainty.
---
It divided Kerala’s Christians but enough in the community clung to the old ways: The cock sacrifices continued, as did traditions in which figures like St George are cast as siblings to fiery goddesses like Kali.
---
In all this, the nascent beginnings of something powerful is visible. Among Hindus, persecution by an alien race wielding a foreign faith would, at one level, spark a soul-searching of sorts. It was clear to most in Goa that what the Portuguese were doing was not merely politics; religion was enmeshed in it.
---
not all Hindus were prepared to submit to this ‘catechism through fear’. 157 Herein lies the impulse that would mark political Hinduism. Life in Goa was tough, with employment, political
---
not all Hindus were prepared to submit to this ‘catechism through fear’. 157 Herein lies the impulse that would mark political Hinduism. Life in Goa was tough, with employment, political status and much else made contingent on Christianization.
---
there were creative strategies also to bypass the imbalance in power. 160 Parking gods just miles outside Goa’s limits, for instance, Hindus wooed converts, encouraging apostasy. 161 Brahmins manufactured rites to re -convert lapsed Hindus: You could bathe in the sea or wash yourself with Ganga water. 162 Shrines outside Goa where exiled deities now resided were often grander than their original seats, in visual defiance of the Portuguese.
---
In the end, the government relaxed its grip, not least because its policies had proved bad for business.
---
Many deities returned to Goa, and Catholics and Hindus began sharing festivals, Christian saints receiving veneration from the latter, 169 and Hindu goddesses winning Catholic devotees.
---
Local culture, it would seem, ultimately triumphed over decrees of the foreigner. But for future Hindu nationalists this was exactly it—Hindus, they would argue, were naively large-hearted. Alien faiths, on the other hand, with the slightest power in so small a quarter as Goa, tended towards aggression. Hindus, it would be lamented, were habitually prepared to forgive the worst horrors; tolerance on their rivals’ part, however, was based only on practical calculations. Old patterns, therefore, would no longer do.
---
To prevent old horrors from recurring, they could neither forgive nor forget. And memories of persecution—and resistance—would one day supply the raw material for articulating a unified, combative Hinduism; one aspiring not only to defend itself but of actively going on the offensive.
---
In Tamil country, thus, there were thirty villages of Paravar converted a decade before via another man’s labours. But this was not because Jesus appealed to this low-ranking group of fishermen, and boat- and salt-makers. Facing competition from rivals in the pearl-fishing sector, the Paravar had sought Portuguese security and were claimed wholesale in a quid pro quo—a commercial rather than spiritual transaction.
---
For missionaries, this more sophisticated glimpse of Hindu ideas generated a problem, for they could no longer simply traffic in stereotypes. 187 They would, instead, have to apply themselves to gathering real knowledge before they could debunk the Hindu system.
---
This was not simple polytheism—if there was a variety of gods in shrines, these were all ‘under’ a formless great being.
---
Jesuits moved into the interior, however, further away from Portuguese arms, these overt connections with politics backfired.
---
As Jesuits moved into the interior, however, further away from Portuguese arms, these overt connections with politics backfired.
---
215 By too openly mixing religion with politics, they had failed their mission.
---
Thomas Stephens, composed the Kristapurana (‘Christ Purana’) in a blend of the Marathi and Konkani languages. Instead of inflicting Latin alone and patronizing lectures, the man crafted a vehicle for Christian ideas, imitating Hindu devotional poetry.
---
where Europeans so far clumsily pushed Eastern concepts into Western moulds—and damned them for not fitting—they now attempted the reverse, veiling imported spiritual cargo in ‘native’ fabric.
---
Catholics were linked too closely with the Portuguese, who, to Hindu elites, lacked dignity. The Parangi (a corruption of ‘Frank’, for Europeans) was pegged with drinking, rowdiness (thanks to sailors), inferior castes (like the fishermen Xavier converted),
---
And it was true that, outside Goa, most converts were of lower caste; a reason why even the Nasranis hesitated to adopt Catholicism.
---
de Nobili turned his gaze to the cream of Hindu society. For if they were wooed, prestige would encase Christianity. 229 It was critical, that is, to aim high and pluck from the top.

Robert de Nobili
---
he embraced their sartorial tastes, dressing hereon like a sanyasi in saffron robes—
---
He even restyled the Christian message—he spoke not of the Parangi Margam but Satya Vedam (‘true religion’), with himself as tattvabodhakar (‘teacher of truth’).
---
By 1610, his Jesuit bosses in Goa learnt that he had acquired a sacred thread, worn by Brahmins across the torso, and that he no longer ate meat. 232 So much so that many believed he was preaching a new religion;
---
De Nobili even invented new rites: When a Brahmin came on, he cut his old sacred thread, and gave him a ‘Christian’ one with a cross. Like Hindus, Madurai’s new Catholics continued to apply sandalwood paste to the foreheads, and before mass, the father performed puja, or worship as in temples.
---
After all, he wrote, ‘I professed to be an Italian Brahmin’;
---
at a time when the church had closed ranks to battle the Reformation in Europe, de Nobili was skating alarmingly close to inventing a brand-new headache.
---
In 1612, they asked him not to separate his high-caste Christians from those ‘reeking with the stench of fish’ 246 serviced by his partner; that all Christians must pray together was not negotiable. The Italian obeyed the letter of the command but violated its spirit by seating converts in separate rows by caste.
---
by the time of his death in 1656, the Madurai mission commanded the loyalty of thousands. There were, unfortunately, not many Brahmins, 253 but other high-born groups were attracted. 254 To his naysayers, then, the Italian Brahmin’s success was its own answer.
---
inculturation grew so strong that when in 1744 Rome withdrew support, it was simply too late—Tamil Catholics were not amenable to European micromanagement. Their faith, while theologically distinct from that of Hindus, shared a ‘common religious idiom’—it had ensconced itself into a Hindu terrain.
---
Essentially, then, Christianity was altered. The Portuguese attacked Nasranis for appearing too Hindu; ironically now, their Catholic faith was succumbing to the same influences. Its greatest proof was the centrality of caste to ‘native’ Christians.
---
Hinduism did not absorb Christianity as it once had tribal cults. Meanwhile, the latter, for its part, while staying separate, maintained a ‘native’ appearance, not posing as pointed a threat as the church in Goa.
---
Christian saints simply joined a general cast of gods and goddesses in these parts.
---
For future Hindu nationalists , though, there was cause for worry, nevertheless. On the one hand, it was clear that political power made all the difference. Goa’s Christianization and demographic transformation, after all, was a result of Portuguese control of the state. The lesson, then, was that Hindus must always retain a grip over authority. But the Madurai formula was no better.
---
The irony, of course, is that this strategy—of much acceptance with some rejection—was how Brahmins too planted their ideas across the subcontinent over the centuries, synthesizing countless groups and tribes into the Hindu order. Viewed this way, de Nobili was following an Indian tradition; the white Brahmin was, inadvertently, enacting the brown one’s playbook,

TWO ‘HEATHENS’ AND HIDDEN TRUTHS
---
Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg

and his colleague, Heinrich Plütschau,
---
sensing that they were ‘more likely to achieve success with children whose minds were still impressionable’, Plütschau and Ziegenbalg began spending their meagre resources on a new school, borrowing when they needed more food and coin. 14 It was an early personification of the idea of mission education in India: something that would proliferate and leave a greater impact in the Hindu world than preaching itself.

Just as different castes and tribes in India chose from a panoply of sects, deities and styles of worship—ranging from ascetic renunciation to boisterous, ecstatic bhakti—Christians were welcome to do what they pleased. But they were expected to operate within a competitive

Just as different castes and tribes in India chose from a panoply of sects, deities and styles of worship—ranging from ascetic renunciation to boisterous, ecstatic bhakti—Christians were welcome to do what they pleased. But they were expected to operate within a competitive spiritual marketplace, not attempt to capture or overturn it.
---
To Christians, theirs was the only bona fide Religion; everything else was diabolical pretension or primitive paganism. That the world might house religions (plural) of varying formats—and, significantly, that Christianity was not unique—was tough to swallow even at a conceptual level.
---
Ziegenbalg’s subtle suggestion—that Christians had no new message to deliver, and that Hindus had within their traditions, strands aligned with the best of Biblical teachings—was a dangerous line.
---
the church was looking neither for nuance nor a research paper on pagan theology. And so, when his thesis arrived in the post, it was denied publication.
---
Missionaries, Ziegenbalg learnt, had better stick to prescribed goals, armoured in dogma; to allow pagan ideas to spark self-doubt was unwise. And if knowledge of local thinking were acquired, this must be deployed only—as we saw in previous cases—to ridicule their source, not reflect on Christianity and its limits.
---
the message foreshadowing the rise of modern Hinduism was this: White men might corner power in India. Where religion and identity were concerned, though, ‘natives’ could—and would—stubbornly continue to refuse instruction.
---
The proposition that Hinduism had higher and lower forms—the first resembling monotheism, the other ‘messily’ polytheistic—was neither new nor a European bifurcation.
---
The gap with monotheisms elsewhere, however, is evident: In the West, principle and practice (largely) coincided. There was one god to whom prayers were addressed. 81 In India, though, the principle sat atop a polytheistic infrastructure: God was one but worship was directed at many deities, 82 drawn from a variety of cults, a few even competing for recognition as the god.
---
where Christians demonized all Hindu deities, some Hindus branded some gods ‘false’ in matching terms.
---
Puranic Hinduism, cross-fertilized by so many sources, never had just one response to things. So, despite naysayers, most Brahmins adapted.
---
White men saw in this hypocrisy and trickery, but to Hindus, this was entirely in keeping with their many-storeyed history and plural personalities.
---
It was Brahmins who typically provided narrative coherence for this diversity of thought and action, tailoring answers to the askers’ expectations. 95 Unsurprisingly, they were showcased as the best candidates to explain Hinduism.
---
Indeed, dialogue with Brahmins opened up a less unkind view of Hinduism among some missionaries.
---
Sectarian intricacies too were identified; Brahmins were not a uniform bloc—there were Vaishnavas (who projected Vishnu as supreme), Saivas (who argued for Siva), Saktas (for whom god was a goddess) and Smartas (who acknowledged all three and more as forms of divinity). 108 Subtler elements were not missed either, such as the ‘ingenious’ Puranic formula of linking temples to the great narrative via stories.
---
Conversion, that is, was positioned not as a choice between falsehood and truth—which failed on Hindus, with their infuriating relativism—but as a road to all milk, zero poison. Just as there were higher and lower paths within Hinduism, Christianity ranked above ‘native’ religion.
---
By the eighteenth century, then, the attitude towards Hindus became a welter of contradictory feelings, ranging from violent opposition to compromise.
---
The Protestant Reformation, combined with dynamics set off by the Renaissance, had led to a so-called Age of Enlightenment.
---
just as Protestants employed arguments against idolatry to discredit Catholics, Western rationalists, sceptics and scientists now calculated that Hindu philosophy might smash the orthodoxy in Europe.
---
So, a reading of Hinduism, intended to buttress European preoccupations, gained intellectual currency.
---
A quest would begin for ‘authentic’ Hinduism, separated from its complicated living culture. The latter was confusing; the former Westerners might understand, and indeed, even exploit for their own purposes.
---
Europe too, that is, was discovering ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ Hinduism. And in isolating the first, and seeking monotheism outside the Christian tradition, it would soon fix its attention

---
ancestral Sanskrit writings. 140 It is ironic that an eighteenth-century Catholic was so anxious to assault Hinduism by stressing the cleavage between scriptural recommendations and actual practice. For this was exactly how the Roman church was assailed by Protestants from the sixteenth century onwards. One of the most stinging charges against Catholicism by Martin Luther had been that it screened off the Bible—in obscure Latin, with translations into vernaculars barred—from the masses. Ordinary Christians were fobbed off with the worship of saints, colourful processions and a camouflaged idolatry, while god’s message circulated among the clerical few. Besides, for all its pretensions to holiness, even the text preserved by Rome was full of errors; in adjudicating the meaning and texture of every concept, the Catholic church had corrupted god’s word.
---
idolatry even on recognizing the ‘Falseness of [such] Gods’. 148 As for the Vedas, if they were really god’s message, why hesitate to reveal them? 149 The answer could only be that either the books were rubbish or that Brahmin exceptionalism and control depended on a monopoly—much like the Catholic clergy.

---
Hindus could not filter truth from falsehood due to unfamiliarity with their texts. If at all fragments were revealed, it was to serve Brahmin interests only.
---
In this Age of Enlightenment, reason and rationality were leading virtues. And while there was a flash of atheism, many thinkers retained faith—except their god was no longer tethered to scripture.

a greater trend: a self-serving romance around the Vedas—in their impenetrable, mysterious language—among Enlightenment minds. 186 Of how the West used Eastern cultures in its own quarrels, alternatively heaping compliments and contempt.
---
In a sense, it was the idea of the Vedas that gripped Europe, not its contents.
---
Simply stated, white thinkers in the West, disillusioned with religion at home, felt the need to idealize an alternative; to construct a counter with which to hem in Christianity. Hinduism—once dismissed as a demonic cult—was presented as just the item.

Like our Mughal prince, who culled portions of the Vedas to ‘find’ his hidden book, Europeans too were picky. They preferred Hinduism’s hazy antiquity—where they could fill in the blanks as suited them—to its living reality. Indeed, digging through the debris that was the Hindu present to revive its past acquired a certain glamour, and all kinds of theories were professed.
---
Hindu convictions were hereafter ‘badly translated, or wrongly interpreted’. 198 The result was that the ‘natives’ grew ignorant, with a (Puranic) ‘sequel’ conflated with (Vedic) originals.
---
And viewed this way, the conclusion was obvious: Hindus’ ‘true religion’ resided in a ‘faithful translation of the Vedams’. 200 Everything else was a weak, toxic appendage, and ought to be discarded to retrieve a purer nucleus—a premise that lingers on to this day.
---
Of course, this was historically unsound. Puranic Hinduism emerged not because of invasions but through an interaction between the Brahmins’ religion, as it migrated with them across the subcontinent, with a variety of local systems. It was the Puranas—exactly the material dismissed now for irrationality, its carnal gods and temples—that was truly representative of Hindus at large. The Vedas, on the other hand, had remained the preserve of a small, select set of Brahmins and scholars.
---
Importing European dynamics into India, white men in effect expected ordinary Hindus—of so many castes, with so many histories, no one like the other—to subscribe purely to an orthodox, ancient Brahmin position, when historically this was a more complex engagement.
---
In other words, foreigners would teach Indians ‘authentic’ Hinduism and where to find it. But this also begs the question: How did Hindus themselves perceive the Vedas traditionally?
---
sects competed to assert that they alone had comprehended the Vedas properly.

The older portions are caled
---
karma-kanda , focused on sacrifice, rituals and invocations to ancient deities (most of whom would be overshadowed by Vishnu and Siva).
---
The vedanta —the ‘end’ of the Vedas, both in a literal and metaphorical sense—meanwhile is the jnana-kanda , the repository of wisdom, containing the Upanishads. These are the pillars of Hindu philosophy.
---
religion was not ‘a series of propositions to be believed but a series of practices to be undertaken’. If the Vedas were unknown to most Hindus—including many Brahmins—so too the Bible was ‘alien to the great majority’ of lay Christians.
---
Yet, there was a difference. For while Christianity drew from a core book, Hindus possessed a wider, segmented archive.
---
stitching up countless groups, ideologies, gods and identities in various periods across vast geographies. 213 Each thread in this evolving web had a personality; each could inform and alter others while retaining its distinctness.
---
Predictably, there were schools that tested this. Some Saiva traditions, for example. 221 One text, the Sivadharmottara brands Vedic studies a ‘waste’. 222 Another subordinates the Vedas; Saiva scriptures emerged from god’s ‘highest’ face, the Vedas only from ‘inferior faces’. 223 In the Narada Sutras , similarly, bhakti triumphs ‘even the Vedas’. 224 Nevertheless, implicit here is recognition of the texts as a gold standard. And in time, most sects, including several ‘propounding anti -Vedic’ ideas, were reconciled via ‘statements of conformity’. 225 Similarly, though the Vedas show little room for image worship, Vedic mantras became an essential component of temple ritual.
---
White writers, though, were oblivious to such nuances. Instead of recognizing the numerous rivulets that together form the Hindu tradition, they assumed that a single fount came first, splintering over time into the seemingly muddy streams and puddles of ‘idolatrous’ Hinduism. In any case, the Hindu attitude vis-à-vis scripture would have scandalized them. For applied to the Western context, this was akin to saying that one could back a range of things—from idols to animal sacrifice—and remain Christian by acknowledging the Bible.
---
Nevertheless, in Western eyes, ‘pure’ Hinduism gained a definite appearance: The Vedas were its Bible, and a certain kind of orthodox, scholarly Brahmin alone could speak for it.
---
It did not matter that this ‘pure’ Hinduism foreigners idealized never existed; to expect all Hindus to become rigid votaries of the Vedas was to construct something artificial. So much so that when in the nineteenth century, ‘native’ figures themselves attempted to raise up a scripturalist Hinduism, the majority ignored them, sticking to their temples and custom.
---
There were always ultraconservative Brahmins who too dismissed temples and mass Hinduism. To these purists also, the Vedas, and nothing but the Vedas, defined Hinduism. Which is why, late in the nineteenth century, as the Hindu religion was defined in a Protestant mould, a Brahmin writer would openly state that what was meant by (modern) Hinduism was ‘Brahmanism’—this even as he admitted that down the ladder, observance of Brahminical norms was only ‘fractional’.
---
Indeed, historically, Brahmin writings were often composed in reaction to preexisting tendencies on the ground—scriptural expostulations compensated for practical inadequacies, and served to help narrative catch up with reality.
---
Now however, a set of Sanskrit books was almost mechanically construed as the ‘authentic’ core of a shambolic religious system—and there were at least some Hindu authorities willing to operate on these terms, energized in their own conservatism by conditions of Western creation.
---
Hindus, after all, rarely sought out an ‘original’ faith: Their religion was mixed, complicated and disputed even—but it was what it was; a living, organic, elastic entity. But then, political events began to make a difference: The advent of the white man’s rule gave white men’s ideas the muscle to remake reality.
---
It was in these circumstances that Hinduism’s current avatar emerged—with one foot in tradition, the other in European sensibilities and confusion.
---
THREE GOVERNING THE GENTOOS
---
Like the Portuguese before, ever since the English established trading posts in the country, they had been interacting with Hindus. But unlike the Portuguese, caution was their first principle:
---
white traders grew rich through exports, their Indian supporters pumped the commissions they earned into traditional channels of patronage.
---
Company-sponsored wealth creation, that is, led to a boom in Hindu practice.
---
In fact, the Company arbitrated caste disputes, 13 while its coins featured Hindu gods.
---
o]ver half of marriages [recorded] at Madras’ in 1700 were between white men and local women. 15
---
The transformation of the Company into what a critic lambasted as ‘a state in the disguise of a merchant’ was a process that lasted an age. 17 If in 1757, the victory of their troops against the nawab of Bengal netted 1,50,000 sq. miles of territory in eastern India, it would be 1849 before the Sikh empire in the north-west folded. Mysore in the south was crushed in 1799, while the Marathas of the Deccan—the subcontinent’s final major force—were defeated in 1818. As for India’s increasingly titular suzerains, the Mughals, the last of them would in 1858 be exiled on a bullock cart to Burma. The whole thing occurred in fits and spurts,
---
The state was certainly embroiled in Company affairs, not only by claiming a portion of Bengal’s income but also because as early as 1764, seventy elected parliamentarians were shareholders of the very corporate machine they would soon be asked to regulate.
---
37 As early as 1772, even an ex-Company employee warned that British-ruled Indian territories would go ‘from bad to worse’, given that its protectors were really profit-miners. 38 In
---
Quarrels broke out between the Board of Control (created by parliament to moderate the Company) and the Company’s directors, 42 and between the directors in turn and men on the ground.

thus, pervaded the British encounter with India, and inconsistencies
---
Internal turmoil, thus, pervaded the British encounter with India, and inconsistencies
---
Internal turmoil, thus, pervaded the British encounter with India, and inconsistencies defined policy in territories the Company swept up.
---
All the proverbial glory linked with conquest, thus, barely masks the uncertainty and stress saturating the British experience in India.
---
What is interesting for our purposes, though, is that this caution at first also extended to Hindu institutions and cultural centres.
---
While political interest in the region hinged on connecting Bengal to Madras on the map, for winning over the people and stabilizing the conquest, the governor general
---
wrote, to take ‘every possible precaution to preserve the respect due to the pagoda’ and honour the ‘sanctity of the religious edifices’ as well as the ‘prejudices of the Brahmins’.
---
Company now, it was the turn of the British to continue the pattern. 58 Or as a report explained, ‘[i]n a political light [the temple’s] value is incalculable.’
---
white men became guardians of gods, managing festivals and religious endowments, British troops marching in Hindu processions.
---
Though some did genuinely respect Hindu culture, few were innocent of the imperial mission; that is, regard for ‘native’ sensibilities emerged from considerations of security.
---
mutiny in Vellore in 1806, a reaction to interference in matters of religion and identity, made the Company nervous.
---
An army could dominate, but not sustain conquest; so, the British would have to compensate by filling Hindu dynastic shoes as seamlessly as possible.
---
At this point, there was no single, dominant strand of imperialism, only skittish variants attempting to establish what might keep ‘native’ energies sedated.
---
This tone is critical: The Company, even if it tolerated Hindu customs, rarely understood or endorsed them. And if it came to conflict between British authority and Hindu ideas, it was clear which would prevail.
---
The Marathas had a king whose power was usurped by the Peshwas long ago. 79 While a proposal that the Company claim Peshwa-hood for itself was set aside, 80 a restoration, albeit in a small enclave, was orchestrated for the king.
---
The restored Maratha chhatrapati (king) was told as much: By no means was Company aid to be construed as reviving ‘even in name’ the Maratha imperium, for then ‘the machine we are setting up will be liable to be turned against

---
The restored Maratha chhatrapati (king) was told as much: By no means was Company aid to be construed as reviving ‘even in name’ the Maratha imperium, for then ‘the machine we are setting up will be liable to be turned against us’.
---
In other words, a foreign corporation was walking a tightrope between its imperial agendas and fitting the mould of a Hindu rajah. And if in Bengal an accident of history made the Company rulers, here there was a conscious—and cautious—building of empire, by alert white hands in a land with many shades of brown.
---
The British must speak to the ‘natives’ in their language, not expect them to lap up English ideals. Thomas Munro (1761–1827), therefore, warned white officers from Madras to avoid being ‘fanatics in politics’. An emerging European tendency to ‘suppose that no country can be saved without [Western] institutions’, must be discarded, for the ‘natives’ already had ‘their own to answer every useful object’. 91 Only such a middle path would permit British power to endure.
---
But then again, precisely because the Company had internal dissonances, there was opposition also to such proposals; there was always an equal number of men who rubbished all this prattle about accommodation.
---
in the British failure to ultimately carry this forward—or bungle it up when they tried—lay a leading trigger for anti-colonial mobilization. Including among preceptors of what we now call Hindu nationalism.
---
British policies and corruption had fractured the economy. The Company was in debt, moreover (Rs 10 million locally
---
Additionally, the land was drained to tip the British government also, which since 1767 demanded a share of the pickings.
---
As was reported less than a decade after the British takeover, this country, ‘which flourished [even] under the most despotic’ nawabi regime, had been steered to famine by its new, supposedly more civilised white rulers.
---
in Bengal, we first observe the sustained effect of colonialism on Hindu society, and of India on British minds.
---
the Company Raj was a detached reign of paper—a mark also of its nervousness, separating it from the society it governed.
---
it was ‘natives’ who were forced to navigate the new floor plan.
---
it was the ‘diversity of customs and institutions’ that intimidated the Company; and in seeking to rule without unravelling this lay ‘the origin of those troubles and those confusions that have been . . . the bane and ruin of the inhabitants’.
---
So, in the end, a good part of British administration was improvisation: a shuffling about to balance commercial advantages with the moral pressure to govern; a contest between making money and trying to care about a people with whom these merchant–rajahs saw little in common.
---
Worse still, the corporate character of British authority puzzled Bengalis: Power was exercised not by a king or dynasty that might develop an emotional stake in the land but by a ‘numerous body’, with impermanent members seeking transient benefit. Bengal was like a house with no master, only parasitic tenants.
---
Several of these defects surfaced in Hastings’s effort—and those of his successors—to delineate ‘Hindu law’.
---
And so, as a well-meaning alien, he would aim for a ‘renewal of the laws and forms established of old’, which had been ‘corrupted and distorted’—an attitude, as we saw in the previous chapter, Western intellectuals applied to Indian culture in general.
---
To start with, what was ‘Hindu law’? The fact is that there was no unitary article of this name, everything being determined by context: region, caste, community, economic background, etc.
---
What was law for a group or province might not fly in another; what was right for a litigant could be abhorrent for the one after—a natural state in a pluralistic society.
---
They never represented Hindu society in full, being an ‘ideologically driven’ (Brahminical) ‘blueprint for the proper management of society’.

They = Sastras
---
They never represented Hindu society in full, being an ‘ideologically driven’ (Brahminical) ‘blueprint for the proper management of society’. 148 With glorious inconsistency, they offered Brahmin-approved options for various concerns.
---
For most Hindus did not live by lawbooks in a language few could read.
---
1820s, an official surveying fifty-six castes in the Deccan concluded, thus, that they had ‘no written documents or books to which they refer’. ‘Ancient usage’ dominated, and only in cases of ‘extraordinary difficulty’ were sastras introduced.
---
the British sought ‘order’, while those living in India already possessed a familiar, evolving system; from their perch, they already had ‘order’.
---
Of course one must watch against romanticizing the existing system; it had flaws that will scandalize modern sensibilities.
---
Or as Guha writes, ‘Customary rights might all too often be but ancient abuses.’
---
So also, as Ziegenbalg was told, the rich settled matters through fines, while the poor suffered full punishment.
---
And yet, to assuage colonial anxieties, he enshrined a strange cross-breed. Texts referred to by a minority of Hindus were repackaged as the ‘law’ of its totality; legal traditions limited to scholarly Brahmins were now deployed as the primary means to read ‘Hindu law’ in toto.

He - Hastings
---
Instead of dealing with Hindus in the present, that is, the white man yet again herded them into a synthetic ‘classical’ past.
---
The Peshwas—themselves Brahmins—had a special incentive in promoting orthodox norms, envisioning a ‘rule by, for and of the Brahmins’; their approach cannot be assumed as the norm for most Hindu rulers.
---
In Rajputana, similarly, Marwar state developed a programme blending orthodox Brahmin and Jain ideas, particularly vegetarianism. And here too, the court’s dictates were often ignored by subordinate chiefs and officeholders.
---
Where local rulers had the cultural resources to negotiate this process, the Company, as an alien entity, flailed.
---
The result was Nathaniel B. Halhed’s A Code of Gentoo Laws (1776). Its preparation was convoluted. Halhed knew Persian but was hopeless in Sanskrit. Eleven Brahmin ‘lawyers’ were summoned from ‘every Part of Bengal’, then, to translate into Persian ‘Sentence by Sentence’ content ‘from various Originals’.
---
And what they set off would, within years, mutate into something unwieldy, frustrating even their countrymen.
---
Interestingly, ‘natives’ were able to adjust somewhat at first. For even as British judges unduly emphasized Sanskrit verse over custom, they relied on Brahmin pandits. 195 And pandits—Hindus living among Hindus—even if they ‘tortured’ texts to fit British standards, managed to bridge them with the people’s ways.
---
But then, in a post-Hastings age, British attitudes changed, undermining ‘native’
---
So, while some judges continued to depend on pandits, many began to interpret and apply ‘Hindu law’ themselves. Except this was more formulaic. If at all Brahmins were consulted, it was by posing abstract questions, without evidence or details of the specific case—
---
lack of historical knowledge generated problems: For years, the courts merrily applied ‘Hindu law’ to Sikhs and Jains, because they had not yet worked out that these groups were not exactly Hindu. 200 And over time, the damage spread:
---
Eventually, then, ‘Hindu law’ became less about Hindus, more about white men and their apprehensions.
---
By 1807, it was reported how the ‘native who has a good cause always applies for a panchayat; while he who has a bad one, seeks the decision of a . . . [British] Judge’ because the system was twisted enough to let the wrong party win.
---
the ‘grotesque absurdity’ of applying Brahminical norms to people with little to do with them.
---
Only when the Company’s attitude stiffened—as we will see—with sober voices being replaced by more hard-line, evangelical thinking, did Hindus turn militant in their opposition. Errors the Portuguese made in Goa the British would begin to commit at a more sophisticated, but no less offensive, scale. And with accommodation—plus the desire for it—fraying, Hindus would resort to a nationalism defined by the one thing their foreign rulers could never partake of with them: religion.
---
ironically, British imperialism in India saw also the rise of a Brahmin collaborator class, serving and aiding the conqueror. In a sense, the Company here followed a pattern set by modernizing Indian states. As kingdoms transitioned from fragmented systems—where rulers shared power with warlords and diffused institutions—into centralized entities, bureaucracies became critical. In Kerala for example, the Travancore rajah crushed his warrior nobility by the mid-eighteenth century, importing Brahmins from Tamil country to run his government.
---
Persian-speaking Telugu Brahmins, similarly, had served the Carnatic nawab, 231 and in the seventeenth century, the last Golconda sultan was the instrument of two Brahmins, leading an increasingly Brahmin secretariat. 232 As early as the sixteenth century, in fact, a Vijayanagara emperor had advocated this formula: to cultivate mobile Brahmin professionals in ‘all departments’ over hereditary strongmen, who, with their autonomous power bases, tested the centre.
---
mid-seventeenth-century Madras, we already find Brahmin officials wielding extraordinary influence. 236 With the conquest or subordination of ‘native’ states, the Company now scaled up this trend.
---
Even in areas which the Company trounced but did not annex, it placed trusted Brahmins in executive posts.
---
the ‘foreigner’ in these contexts was not only the white man but also his Brahmin aide; Company Raj also enabled a Brahmin Raj.
---
The wonder would not last though: In time, Brahmins would become leading promoters of nationalism in India. Either way, just as the Company had divergent voices within, Indian responses too were not uniform at this stage.
---
Among some men at least, then, the British, despite foreign roots and Christian origins, were viewed as new rajahs;
---
For worldly Brahmins too, this was not radical—they could come to terms with white men as they once had the Mughals. Their very presence in Company offices demonstrated a knack for survival.
---
One might argue that as beneficiaries of British rule, these Hindus had reason to air positive views. Besides, as Brahmins they might have been pleased by the attention the new dispensation gave their texts and traditions.
---
Hindus of political backgrounds—pressed by the Company’s might—struggled, however. ‘Hindu law’, for instance, benefitted the Company in statecraft. Brahminical theory recognized kingship only for Kshatriyas—the second of the four ‘classical’ caste groups. But Indian princes were often descended from the peasantry; Kshatriyahood was negotiated and acquired. Armed with hardboiled textualism though, the British could declare Hindu rulers bogus:
---
So, even if the rajah were backed by his ‘chief people’ and ‘general opinion’, 256 his status was made reliant on book-wielding Brahmins of a different province.
---
as the anthropologist Bernard Cohn observed, the conquest of India was as much a ‘conquest of knowledge’ as it was of land and goods.
---
the legally enshrined colonial bifurcation of Indian society into two master groups now allowed it a more concrete life. That is, where Hindus had various forms of self-conception, sometimes in tension with one another, the government’s approach empowered religion as an overarching, unifying principle. What was a fuzzy, incomplete feeling received hereon a definite impetus. Coupled in future with colonial censuses, Hindus would slowly begin to conceive of themselves in a new manner.

FOUR ‘AN INDIAN RENAISSANCE’
---
In the summer of 1826, the bishop of Calcutta arrived at the court of the rajah of Tanjore in southern India.
---
What Heber saw in Delhi, then, were the last trickles of old wealth and ‘native’ majesty; behind appearances, the Mughal crown looked perfectly hollow. Serfoji II of Tanjore (1800), courtesy of the National Museum of Denmark.
---
In Tanjore, however, the bishop was pleasantly surprised. To begin with, there was a mission at work here with a thriving community of Christians: 1300 Tamils attended a service where he was present.
---
the local Maratha rajah,
---
a glimpse of the rajah’s material and intellectual universe—a far cry from the rot so palpable in the house of the Mughals.
---
Rajah Serfoji Bhonsle II of Tanjore (1777–1832)
---
Where the Mughal emperor’s throne, devastated as much by British contempt as by pigeons, served as an artefact of expired greatness, here was a seemingly virile mind, embracing the technological and material promise of the West, matching also many cultural benchmarks.
---
Leaving aside the cliché of Eastern depravity, which came so naturally to even the kindest European voices, it was clear that on his Western visitors, Serfoji made a most uncommon impression.
---
Observing the fate of maharajahs whose lands were ‘assumed’ by the British, a senior official would in time remark how ‘the loss of much of their real power’ tended to make Indian princes ‘anxious to preserve forms that yet remain of royalty’.
---
Tanjore was once the seat of the medieval Chola emperors, and then the Nayaka dynasty linked to Vijayanagara. Serfoji’s Maratha ancestors came here as agents of an enemy sultan to assist the last of the Nayakas in a contest, only to quickly seize the kingdom for themselves.
---
The Tanjore Marathas styled themselves Choladesadhipathi, Cholabhupathi and Cholasimhasanadhipathi (Lords of Chola country) and after a pilgrimage in 1801, Serfoji consecrated in the great temple 108 lingams brought from different parts of the region.
---
With the little authority left in him as master of a single fort-city, and the monetary resources the British allotted him, the rajah also inaugurated what has been called the ‘Tanjore Renaissance’ and the ‘Tanjore Enlightenment’. 22 It was, to quote a scholar, ‘a knowledge-making process that combined indigenous wisdom with all that was relevant and useful’ in Western culture; it produced modern knowledge that yet remained ‘rooted in tradition’.
---
Serfoji founded institutions for Vedic studies, meeting Brahmin ideals of kingly conduct. But on the other, he also established twenty-one schools offering free education of the European kind, albeit ‘disengaged from Christian frames of reference’.
---
—gave students instruction in five languages: Tamil (of the masses), Marathi (of his court), Telugu (a prestigious language from Vijayanagara’s heyday), Persian (favourite of the Mughal order), and, of course, English (from India’s new overlords).
---
caste rules were relaxed; orphans and disabled children were admitted; and food and board provided to all in need of
---
As always, however, ‘untouchables’ were not permitted.
---
Products of the Tanjore system would in time spread across southern India, achieving distinction—
---
Only an Indian well versed in European and ‘native’ ideas both could pull off something like this; only a Serfoji could Indianize the white man’s knowledge and smoothly blend it with local culture.
---
the Sarasvati Mahal library. Originally under the Nayakas, its expanded shelves now featured 4500 books in Western languages, and ten times as many Indian manuscripts.
---
European music occupied thirty volumes, with local performers trained to play both the Indian veena and the piano.
---
To Serfoji, though, this was no paradox: Embracing knowledge, no matter its provenance, sat comfortably with ‘native’ ideals. To admire European advancements did not equal a wholesale purchase of European culture. He could operate both medieval shrines and study cadavers, just as he might use age-old poetic techniques to communicate fresh lessons.
---
The British thought Hindus no good, believing their glories to have faded with the ancient past; and yet here was an exhibit who, even if at a modest scale, achieved greatness in the present. But sadly, little was carried forward: After the rajah died in 1832, the ‘Tanjore Renaissance’ wilted, with only paler versions following in other courts. 61

Showing an interest in local culture ‘lessen[ed] the weight of the chain by which the natives are held in subjection’. 72 The chain itself was non-negotiable, but with the right sounds, Indians could be lulled into ignoring it.

In India, these were often officials moonlighting as savants, with a stated desire for unearthing and disseminating knowledge about the East in the West.
---
India—their appetite to ‘know’ the country stemmed more from wanting to better rule it.
---
around the same time that Serfoji grew besotted with modern science, white officials launched a romance of sorts with ancient India and its mysteries.
---
there was a history to the land—and Hinduism—beyond the ‘language of the gods’.
