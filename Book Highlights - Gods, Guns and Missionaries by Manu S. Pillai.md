> For few Europeans had direct experience of the topics they described, with the result that unChristian subjects were pressed into ready-made, more familiar Christian templates. As multi-armed, many-headed Hindu deities were heard of, these too were retrofitted into available medieval categories. Or as Mitter tells, ‘classical monsters and [pagan] gods, Biblical demons and Indian gods were all lumped together’ in one universal master class: that of ‘monsters’.

> As for the Hindus, at first India’s residents could not have cared for what itinerant Europeans were writing about them, their gods and culture. But as the white man’s political power grew in the country, his skewed narratives—and the prejudice these came to represent—acquired the ability to afflict their world. And so, these would slowly become a threat, till in time Hindus themselves were forced to answer the question: Who were they, really? If not devil-worshippers, what was their religion truly about? In a world where other (unfriendly) cultures could scrutinize their identity, how might they articulate their self-image? It was in the construction of these answers that Hinduism took its contemporary, modern form, drawing pride and confidence from certain aspects of its past and shame from others.

Alien faiths, on the other hand, with the slightest power in so small a quarter as Goa, tended towards aggression. Hindus, it would be lamented, were habitually prepared to forgive the worst horrors; tolerance on their rivals’ part, however, was based only on practical calculations. Old patterns, therefore, would no longer do.

For this was exactly how the Roman church was assailed by Protestants from the sixteenth century onwards. One of the most stinging charges against Catholicism by Martin Luther had been that it screened off the Bible—in obscure Latin, with translations into vernaculars barred—from the masses. Ordinary Christians were fobbed off with the worship of saints, colourful processions and a camouflaged idolatry, while god’s message circulated among the clerical few. Besides, for all its pretensions to holiness, even the text preserved by Rome was full of errors; in adjudicating the meaning and texture of every concept, the Catholic church had corrupted god’s word.

In a sense, the Company here followed a pattern set by modernizing Indian states. As kingdoms transitioned from fragmented systems—where rulers shared power with warlords and diffused institutions—into centralized entities, bureaucracies became critical. In Kerala for example, the Travancore rajah crushed his warrior nobility by the mid-eighteenth century, importing Brahmins from Tamil country to run his government.
