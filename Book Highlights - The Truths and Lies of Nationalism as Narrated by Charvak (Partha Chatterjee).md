##### India is Not a Pluralist Secular Democracy
- In broad terms, Gandhi believed that Indians were a religious people and that Indian society was held together by religion. Everywhere, there was a common truth which was a mutual respect for the ways of living of others. This sometimes meant mutually agreed rules of separation: we will not interfere when you carry your idols in a procession, just as you will not play music in front of our mosques when we pray. Rules of separation had been worked out and were well understood. These practices varied from region to region, from one locality to another. Outside the strict control of scripture and rules of orthodoxy, this was the ordinary religious life, which, Gandhi believed, contained the essential truth of religious tolerance.

  His location was never within some secular space of the state, unmarked by religious difference. Then why did Gandhi fail in his attempt to keep the country together? To give you a short answer, I think it was because he put the entire burden of maintaining tolerance and harmony on the self-regulating mechanisms of society. Gandhi was fundamentally against the use of government machinery or the law to influence or change religious customs, even when he agreed that those customs might be harmful or unjust. Social self-regulation of the Gandhian kind became a victim of the politics of majorities and minorities.

- There was a different approach taken by those who were learned in the sacred texts to make the same point – that the Hindu religion taught tolerance and respect for all religions. Swami Vivekananda was one of the first among them. Interestingly, in his Chicago speech in 1893, although he mentioned Jews and Zoroastrians as communities which had been given shelter in India, Vivekananda did not once mention Islam as a religion that was also practised by many in the country.

  The use of the Advaita Vedanta to claim that, despite countless differences in doctrine and practice, the Hindu religion has a fundamental unity served a clear political purpose. It asserted that from ancient times the people of India had the cultural resources in their religious tradition to respect differences while, at the same time, uniting to pursue common tasks. The

- Rabindranath Tagore was also a renowned figure who spoke of unity in diversity. He was born in a Brahmo family. Yet Rabindranath was resolutely opposed to nationalism. In fact, he argued that precisely because Indian society had achieved its cohesion while preserving its diversity, it must not copy Europe and try to become a nation. European nations were racially and culturally homogeneous. Indian society would be destroyed if the cultural politics of nationalism was imposed on it.

  The political effect was to privilege the Hindu religion and its associated culture as the adhesive (bandhan) that held together a nation otherwise divided into numerous castes, sects, and communities. I say this was a political effect because without the new impulse to project the existence of an Indian nation that could make a rightful claim of self-government against the British colonial power, this particular vision of something called the Hindu religion would have been irrelevant. It became a political metaphor of nationalism.

  This had two important consequences. First, other religious traditions became minor or subordinate elements that illustrated diversity while the Hindu tradition became the force that united and gave shelter to others. The second effect followed from the first. It provided philosophical and cultural legitimacy to the politics of Hindu majoritarianism.

- Nehru told a story in which the religious pluralism of local societies was brought together with the administrative policies of the state to picture the vibrant presence of a common culture that united the Indian nation. The historical version of unity in diversity, combining culture and state policy, has become synonymous with Nehruvian secularism.

  The particular version of pluralism popularised by Nehru emphasised the fact that it was fostered not merely by cultural exchanges among different groups of people but actively promoted and enforced by the administrative machinery of the state. Hence, the history of pluralist civilisation in India is as much a cultural history as a history of state policy. This leads to the detailed study of the great state formations which, for reasons of their large territorial scale and robust administrative structures, have left behind the largest volume of records on how they functioned. As a result, the history of pluralism, or unity in diversity, in India is marked by a succession of great empires – the Maurya, the Gupta, the Delhi Sultanates, the Vijayanagara, the Mughal, the Maratha, the British. The history of Indian civilisation is not the history of everyone who lives in India. On the contrary, by glorifying the culture of the powerful, the wealthy, and the learned, it produces a myopic view of what is valuable in the nation’s past.

- What is the implication for a national idea that is pluralist? The lesson is that one must have a centralised bureaucratic state claiming sovereignty over the whole territory of the country and enforcing state policies of non-interference in religious freedom and toleration of difference. But this immediately creates a problem. The territory of the country, as I have explained to you already, is, for the most part, as it was left behind by our British rulers. This territory does not coincide with those of any of the earlier empires. Consequently, the search for a historical tradition of the pluralist state inevitably privileges the Maurya Empire under Asoka or the Mughal Empire under Akbar which had both a large expanse of territory and a record of religious tolerance.

  This, if you think about it carefully, has the effect of focusing the geographical imagination of pluralist India on the Gangetic plains of northern India as the ground from which policies for promoting diversity must spring that could be put into practice by a centralised bureaucracy. Examples from other parts of the country where smaller kingdoms, such as in Kerala or Kashmir or Bijapur or the Tamil region or Manipur, may have also promoted pluralism but in ways that were quite different were marginalised because they did not have the imperial scale of the state that men like Nehru envisioned for independent India.

  The historical examples of pluralist state policy involved large polities ruled by enlightened monarchs surrounded by ministers and courtiers drawn from elite circles. None of them were democracies that had to be ruled with the express consent of the people. How could such a history inform state policy in republican India?

- In the first two decades after independence, Nehru and other liberal-minded politicians, bureaucrats, and lawyers put in place the laws and administrative practices of what is known as Nehruvian secularism. Even though the new republic began its journey towards democracy, it was still led by an enlightened elite surrounded by the aura of being the liberators of the nation.
==========



By the late 1960s, it became clear that the secular outlook of enlightened pluralists would have to be modified and, some might say, corrupted in order to cope with the pressures of democracy.
==========



Secularism was invented in this country no earlier than the 1930s. Before that, there was no word in any Indian language to mean what is now meant by secularism. The idea emerged in the particular context of what was happening in Indian politics, especially in northern India, at the time.
==========



Most of the time, and in most ordinary contexts, the primary community with which a person would identify was the caste (jāti) to which he or she belonged. But a jati was defined within a limited geographical region.
==========



on occasions when a larger community was defined by the name Hindu, the castes that were included in it varied from region to region. Further, nowhere were the untouchable castes included within the category of Hindu.
==========



the movement in UP to separate Hindi from Urdu in the early-twentieth century was a major step in the growth of the awareness that there was a Hindu majority in northern India that could be mobilised; second, it was explicitly posed as a counter to the perceived cultural dominance of an old Muslim gentry; and third, that its immediate objective was to secure a firm foothold for upper-caste Hindus in the expanding structures of the bureaucracy and the education system.
==========



Even though India’s leaders wanted the new state to be secular, it became clear at the time of making the constitution that foreign models would not work. Something different – an Indian variety of secularism – would have to be invented.
==========



It guaranteed every person the freedom of conscience and the right to freely practise, profess, and propagate religion.10 But at the same time, the state was given the power to restrict any economic, political, or other secular activity associated with a religious practice, and reform Hindu religious institutions and open them to all Hindus
==========



Religion should concern only beliefs and ceremonial rituals. In all other matters, the state must be allowed to make laws to ensure social progress.12 Nonetheless, apart from individual freedom of religion, limited by the power of state intervention, the constitution also recognised the rights of religious communities. Thus every religious denomination (sampradāy) was given the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage its own religious affairs, and own and administer property in accordance with the law.13 Further, it allowed religious and linguistic minorities to establish and maintain their own educational institutions and prohibited the state from discriminating against them in granting financial aid.14 Interestingly, while the constitution prohibited religious instruction in any institution wholly maintained by state funds, it allowed such instruction in schools and colleges set up by a religious endowment or trust even if it received government grants, provided individual students were not forced to attend such sessions against their wishes.
==========



What emerged as Indian secularism did not fit the definitions of the secular state anywhere else in the world.
==========



There was no strict separation since the state was allowed to intervene in religion. At the same time, the state was not entirely neutral between different religions since it intervened in some religions more than in others. The argument was made that this was necessary because the social and political considerations were different.
==========



Once the state decided to make laws to give itself powers to engage with religion, secularism in India became centrally concerned with the law. The basic problem was one of determining the exact line within which the state may justifiably intervene in the activities of religious institutions and beyond which things must be left in the hands of religious authorities. Judges began to define and draw this line by interpreting religious texts and customs and deciding what was essential to that religion
==========



In defining the essence of religion, judges tended to privilege an abstract philosophical conception of religion, supported by modern interpretations of religious texts, and were dismissive of popular practices that appeared to be mere superstition.
==========



Religious leaders in the old days would take their disputes to the king with the expectation that he would provide an impartial resolution. Now that the British had left, our judges began to think of the court as playing the role of an impartial but socially progressive monarch.
==========



British judges began the practice of including in their judgments their interpretation of these supposedly traditional laws so that Indian litigants would be satisfied that the foreign judges were not acting out of ignorance. As a result, by the time of independence, legal precedents on the personal and religious laws of Hindus and Muslims were full of these judicial interpretations of religious texts. Indian judges, deeply familiar with these precedents, continued the same practice after independence, to the extent of following the same linguistic idiom. If you read the language used in our court judgments these days, you will notice that most judges have read their dharmashastra in English translation and argue on Indian religions like British judges in colonial times.
==========



India is a People’s Federation
==========



When the very lives of people are at stake, it is the state and not the national government which comes to the forefront.
==========



the territories and peoples that are now part of India do not have some mysterious bond of unity going back to antiquity. They have been brought together into a single political unit as a result of British conquests, Indian political movements and their internal divisions, the negotiated transfer of power and partition, and the integration into the Indian Union of the princely states and the French and Portuguese colonial possessions. There is a particular legal framework that defines the relations between the different units of the federation with the centre. That framework too has evolved since the constitution was written.
==========



The constitutional history is a history of the state structure. It describes how, after the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, the British conquered territory, subjugated the regional kingdoms, and put together a new imperial political order. That is the basic state structure, embellished by constitutional reforms in the twentieth century, which the independent Indian state inherited. True, it enveloped all that within a new democratic and republican constitution. But the basic logic by which the state machinery functioned was still imperial
==========



People often forget that the fundamental step towards building a democratic federation (lokătāntrik saṅgh) in India was taken a hundred years ago when the Indian National Congress, soon after Gandhi became its leader, decided to reorganise its provincial committees along linguistic lines, disregarding the provincial boundaries created by the colonial state.
==========



It was a crucial move that enabled the national movement to strike deep roots in different parts of the country and send its message to millions beyond the small upper-class elite
==========



the leaders whose politics had been to oppose the colonial bureaucracy were now in charge of that bureaucracy, their priorities suddenly changed. They felt that the need of the hour was to preserve the state machinery; democracy could wait. It is remarkable how Congress leaders who had earlier thrived on mass movements now became apprehensive of popular mobilisation.
==========



the state came down to us through a history that was imperial. Regardless of our new democratic constitution, the inner principle by which the machinery of the state works is still imperial.
==========



The multilingual character of the Indian nation reflects the unique fact that the Indian nation is a federation of peoples (lokăsaṅgh) – many peoples, each formed by the bonds of a language. The Indian nation is the result of the fact that many peoples speaking many languages agreed to come together to form a single nation with a single democratic and federal state.
==========



while the people of each linguistic region accepted that it belonged to the Indian nation, each had a different idea of what this Indian nation meant. Those were the terms under which all of these peoples agreed to come together in a federation.
==========



the myth of Aryavarta as the centre of Indian civilisation, the history of successive imperial states, and the emergence of Hindi as a language of public discourse have combined to create the widely held impression that the upper-caste North Indian Hindu male speaking Hindi, whether as mother tongue or an adopted language, is the typical representative Indian.

This could explain most Indian struggles I guess!
==========



The Indian nation undoubtedly exists in every part of the country. But in each region, the people with a shared language developed a specific conception of their nationhood while, at the same time, defining their place within the larger Indian nation. This truth demands that the Indian state grant a legitimate and equal political place within the Indian national federation to each of these constituent but different peoples. That is the truth which has been denied so far by the Indian state, regardless of which party has held power.
==========

You must remember that federalism operates with territorial units. This means that it has
==========



the state (rājya) is not identical to the nation (rāṣṭra). The former has been inherited from our imperial rulers; the latter is constituted by the people (lok) themselves. The people of each state have agreed to live together with the people of all the other states within the same Indian constitution because they have, each in their own way, negotiated the terms of the union. This is, therefore, the first principle: each constituent people of the Indian union is different and must be recognised and respected as such.
==========



The second principle is that while the people of each state is different in quality (guṇ), in its status (sammān) within the federation each is equal to the others. This is not merely a matter of being formally equal in law. It must be an active principle in the functioning of the federation. This is precisely the reason why it is unwise to have some states that are so much larger than the others that they can wield a degree of power that causes resentment within the federation. But relative size is only one aspect of the problem. Even greater is the problem of perception. If some people feel that they are the original and permanent members of the nation and others have been admitted only as a gesture of goodwill or perhaps by political necessity, then the rule of equal respect is violated.
==========



The third principle is that the people must have priority, not the state machinery.
==========



The demand for linguistic states was opposed on the plea that it would disrupt the stability of the state. Policy in Jammu and Kashmir has been driven most of the time by giving priority to the Indian state’s relation with the Pakistani state: the wishes of the Kashmiri people have played almost no role at all. The Indian government’s policy in the north-east in the last seventy years has been similarly dictated by the urge to secure a border region: the people who live there have been considered too few in number and too insignificant in influence to matter. No surprise, therefore, that Kashmir and the north-east are regions where it is considered legitimate to deploy the armed forces against Indian citizens.
==========



Why is the state given priority over the people? Who gives it this priority? It is those who think they have primary ownership of the Indian state because, as representatives of the essential core of the Indian nation, they have inherited the state from the British. They believe it is their duty to protect and preserve the state against people who they see as newcomers who don’t share the same view of nationalism and whose loyalties to the nation are questionable. Those who hold this view are not just a handful of patriarchal politicians and stuffy bureaucrats. The equation between the preservation of the existing state machinery and the interest of the core of the nation is assumed by an influential part of the Indian people.
==========



from the late-nineteenth century, the idea of an Indian nation originating in ancient Vedic society took hold among educated Indians. It was solidified into a fully developed nationalist ideology in northern and western India in the early-twentieth century through the claim that the Hindus of this region were the first and most genuine Indian nationalists. In Maharashtra, this took the form of the celebration of Shivaji and the Brahman-led Maratha Empire. In northern India, the key elements of this nationalist ideology were the Sanskrit tradition, memories of Rajput resistance to Muslim conquest, and the rise of Hindi instead of Urdu as the language of education and government. From the mid-twentieth century, these two streams have converged to form a nationalist ideology which emphasises the need for a strong state machinery, centralised as far as possible, that is able to display a nation unified in its tradition and culture. In the first three decades after independence, this ideology was able to accommodate the idea of a pluralist democracy. In more recent times, however, it has been swamped by waves of nationalist propaganda that declares India to be a Hindu Rashtra whose tradition and culture are genuinely represented only by upper-caste Hindus who also speak Hindi.
==========



shift in the cultural content of nationalism can also be seen in the way the idea of Indian citizenship has changed. In 1950, Articles 5 to 11 of the constitution declared that anyone living in India who did not claim citizenship of another country was an Indian citizen. There was no question about one’s religion or language nor was the nationality of one’s parents relevant.
==========



This idea of citizenship was strengthened by the Citizenship Act of 1955 which declared that anyone born in India was entitled to Indian citizenship.
==========



But this enlightened idea of Indian citizenship was cast aside in 2003 when the Vajpayee government amended the Citizenship Act to bring in a completely different idea – that of being descended from Indians.
==========



At the same time, the 2003 amendment granted overseas citizenship to people of Indian origin who had left the country to become citizens of other countries.
==========



it was meant to flatter the nationalist egos of those who had abandoned their country to grab the chance of bringing up their children in the West.

But it makes the nationalist educator deeply anxious. If all we are doing is copying formulas that have worked in other countries, what happens to the distinctness of our culture? How is the next generation to be educated in it? That is the reason why even the most ambitious modernising effort must be presented as nothing other than an affirmation of ancient Indian heritage.

==========



these random insertions of elements from the so-called Sanskrit knowledge systems occur because even the slightest similarity is believed to be sufficient to justify the claim that modern education is nothing, and indeed must be nothing, but the elaboration of a pedagogical ideal well established in India’s ancient past. The superficial scattering of Sanskrit names and concepts fosters a vague spirit of reverence for a particular cultural heritage without encouraging its critical appraisal.
