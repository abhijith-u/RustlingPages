[Untouchable (Mulk Raj Anand)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162.Untouchable)

A poignant, raw portrayal of caste discrimination in pre-Independent India (and, unfortunately, current India as well).

Mulk Anand Raj lays out a day in the life of the Bhangi caste sweeper Bakha and his family, and the exploitation they face from the society which depends on them for cleaning up its own filth, both physical and spiritual. The insults Bakha & his family face at the hands of the upper caste, the things they have to endure to survive a day is captured superbly through Anand's writing.

The paradoxical plight of the average outcaste is beautifully captured in certain moments where, instead of blaming the society for ill-treating him, Bakha internalises that it is because of his "pollution" that he probably deserves all the abuse, and thus controls himself from lashing out at his oppressors. Shopkeepers try to sell to him at bigger prices for lesser quantity, and he can't question them back. Even an accidental touch of his causes an upper caste man to go berserk and physical abuse him in the marketplace. Bakha's attempt to have a look at the idol inside the temple from the outer steps causes a huge uproar among the 'devotees,â€™ but no one bats an eye when the temple priest is accused of trying to molest his sister Sohini.

Some other incidents, such as Gandhi's impractical ideas on caste eradication and his opposition to the separate electorate are strewn into the story. The subsequent discussion between a poet and a western-educated "intellectual" throws up some interesting highlights.

At many junctures in the story, the sheer audacity and sense of entitlement exhibited by the so-called upper castes in the society are just terrible. Unfortunately, the depressing part is that this is still the bitter reality of everyday life for many outcastes.
