> 'There are three Dhirubhai Ambanis' one of his fellow Gujaratis, a writer-told me. One is unique, larger than life, a brand name. He is one of the most talked about industrialists, and for Gujarati people he has tremendous emotional and sentimental appeal. He is their ultimate man, and has inspired many emulators. The second Dhirubhai Ambani, is a schemer, a first-cass liar who regrets nothing and has no values in life. Then there is the third Dhirubhai Ambani, who has a more sophisticated political brain, a dreamer and a visionary, almost Napoleonic. People are always getting the three personalities mistaken.'

> 'If the stock exchange dares to expose Ambani, he tells it: I will pull my company shares out and make you collapse. I am bigger than your exchange. If the newspapers criticise, he can point out they are dependent on his advertising and he has his journalists in every one of their departments. If the political parties take a stand against him, he has his men in every party who can pull down or embarrass the leaders. He is a threat to the system. Today he is undefeatable.'

> Among the Gujaratis, the people of Kathiawar are renowned for their exuberance of speech, inventiveness and commercial drive. They were the first to go out of India for better prospects. Adventure is second nature to them. They have less hypocrisy. All of the other business communities affect modesty to the point of hypocrisy. Dhirubhai Ambani is part of that culture.

> Centuries before the modern banking system, Vaisya shroffs or bankers were the conduits of a highly monetised Indian economy, remitting vast sums around India at short notice through a sophisticated trust system based on hundi (promissory notes). The commercial instincts of Gujarat’s Vaisya were encouraged by a convenient interpretation of Hinduism preached by the holy man Vallabhacharya in his wanderings around the region early in the 16th century. The Jain and Buddhist religions, which had sprung from Hinduism, also preached privation, renunciation and destruction of the self. Vallabhacharya saw a personal god who created and sustained life, for whom living life to the full was a form of devotion. His school became known as Vaishnavism. It was a philosophy that justified their way of life and gave a divine purpose to their roles as providers and family members. It also fitted the rising social status of the Banias in Gujarat, overriding the formal varna hierarchy.

> The industrialists also saw in the Bania-born Gandhi a counterforce within the Indian National Congress-the main secular vehicle of the independence movement-to the socialist and communist ideas that had taken a strong grip on the thinking of educated Indians. Gandhi’s ideas of industrial devolution to the villages were intrinsically opposed to the proposals for state capitalism and central planning of investment then being promoted by the Left in India as elsewhere in the world.

> Among the sweeping economic changes of 1969 was one small legislative amendment that had the effect of entrenching corruption, though its ostensible intention had been the opposite. Until then, a section of the Companies Act allowed directors to make political contributions to any party. This was repealed in 1969. As on of the officials who supervised the amendment later admitted, this led to political payments by black money.

> The Higher Unit Value Scheme was a government initiative in India during the early 1970s. It allowed exporters to import polyester filament yarn (PFY) in exchange for exporting higher-value textiles like nylon fabric. The scheme aimed to boost export earnings and address the domestic shortage of PFY.

Note to Self:
Here's how it worked:
1. Export Incentive: Exporters who sold textiles at higher prices were rewarded with the right to import PFY.
2. Profit Opportunity: Since the domestic price of PFY was much higher than the international price, importers could make significant profits by selling the imported PFY in India.
3. Market Impact: This scheme led to a surge in exports, particularly to weaker economies, and allowed companies like Reliance to dominate the polyester market in India.
4. Dhirubhai capitalized on this scheme, making substantial profits and expanding his business significantly. However, there were allegations that some of these exports were not genuine, and that illegal methods were used to generate export earnings

> Indira Gandhi’s return to power opened a golden period for Dhirubhai Ambani. In 1979, his company barely made it to the list of India’s 50 biggest companies, measured by annual sales, profits or assets. By 1984, Reliance was in the largest five.

> 1983-84 : Dhirubhai had considerable influence in government. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee tailor-made policies like modifying the rules for foreign investments in India to support shell companies floated by Reliance to invest in their own companies as NRIs.

> the UTI chairman, M. J. Pherwani.’ Dhirubhai and Pherwani became close, and their success fed off each other’: Reliance’s rising share price meant rising values of UTI units; UTI’s heavy investment in Reliance helped Dhirubhai keep the price going up.

---
> Dhirubhai continued to enjoy beneficial policy changes throughout the rest of Indira’s second prime ministership, thanks to the influence of friends like Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Indira’s secretary R. K. Dhawan.

---
> The challenge to State Power lies in the accumulated wealth and economic clout in the hands of an individual who is neither an elected representative nor accountable to the people, who could manipulate Cabinet ministers as wed as party chiefs. Economic power goes hand in hand with its political counterpart, resulting in manipulating politicians and ministers’s right to the top of the top.

> the Indian Express launched its expose of Reliance with a misleadingly theoretical-looking piece on the merits of allowing conversion of the unconvertible security, carrying the modest by-line Gurumurthy’
> 
> *'If the main rule prohibits something, get a sub-rule added which permits it. The main rule will no doubt exist in the book but the book alone. Business thrives on such rules. Touts make their fortunes, politicians enhance their power and bureaucrats their importance. Rule of law at once becomes sub-rule of law and sub- rule eventually becomes Subversive rule. Let us get down to specifics.*
> 
> It was not the way a practised journalist would have opened, but Gurumurthy set out a powerful argument against the practice that had become a hallmark for Dhirubhai - raising debt by offering attractive interest rates and then converting it to cheap equity, by the innovative path of converting supposedly non- convertible debentures into shares. This risked destroying the whole principle behind the distinction between convertibles and nonconvertibles, reflected in the lower premium and higher interest rate on non- convertibles, Gurumurthy pointed out. No one would bother with convertible issues if it were allowed as a general practice. 
>
>*‘There is yet another mischief*,’ Gurumurthy noted. *‘Those corporate managements which deal in their own securities can abuse this licence by buying these nonconvertible debentures at a lower price and thereafter announcing conversion. There were allegations of this abuse in the only case of conversion of the nonconvertible in recent stock market history’.*

> licences, quotas, permits and other largesse’s by Government’s Business controlled important government decisions through their lobbying operations in New Delhi. This was how a project had been smuggled from the government sector to a private company. In 1980-81, the Petroleum Ministry had been working on plans for a petrochemicals refinery at Mathura, which included a 150,000 tonne a year purified terephthalic acid plant. In March 1981, Reliance had submitted its licence application for a PTA plant the same size. To overcome the Petroleum Ministry’s resistance, its Secretary was transferred in July 1983. In October 1984, Reliance got its preliminary approval for a 75 000 tonne plant. The proposed PTA plant at Mathura was cut back to 75 000 tonnes, and had been stalled in any case by lack of government funds.
>
>Thanks to the help of Finance Minister Mukherjee, Reliance looked like having 100 per cent of India’s PTA production and 34 per cent of the country’s combined DMT and PTA output. Its control of other feedstocks, by-products and end-products in the polyester chain ranged from 38.6 per cent up to 62.5 per cent, according to Gurumurthy. India’s anti-monopoly law defined a dominant undertaking as one with more than 24 per cent of national installed capacity, but none of Reliance’s applications had been referred to the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission.

> Otherwise the business press retained its admiration for Dhirubhai, while listing the charges brought by the Express. After the loan mela articles, the magazine Business India wrote that *‘serious as these allegations are, the candid reaction in most corporate circles was a ‘Hats off to Ambani gutsy genius in circumventing the complicated and often suffocating web of corporate laws and regulations that plague Indian business’s*. The magazine quoted unnamed merchant bankers and executives praising Dhirubhai’s financial wizardry and guts and ‘intricate jugglery of high finance’. The simplicity of his schemes bordered on genius: the man was ‘unabashedly a go-getter’. The Business India writers, Mukkaram Bhagat and Dilip Cherian, concluded that it was *‘the commercial banks, much more than Reliance itself, which have been caught on a sticky wicket. For a long time to come, the rights and wrongs of the so-called “loan mela” will be hotly debated. What is really new in the Reliance affair is the scale and the masterly skill with which Ambani had the banks failing over each other, only to reveal the hollowness of an over-regulated system.'*

> As well as recalling Katre’s intervention to have the Express critic Gurumurthy arrested under the Official Secrets Act in 1987, Shourie listed five investigations that had been buried by the CBI under Katre’s direction. The alleged gift of Rs 250 million power plant by a foreign supplier; over-invoicing of raw material imports for PTA production; the surreptitious addition of a paraxylene plant to the Reliance complex at Patalganga without an industrial licence; clandestine royalty payments for chemical processes; and the antedating of letters of credit in 1985 to obtain Rs 1 billion worth of foreign exchange.

> Around the end of 1993, most of Dhirubhai’s old Aden colleagues remaining in service were eased out into retirement. The family also formalised a split of assets that saw Dhirubhai’s two brothers Ramnikbhai and Nathubhai give up their remaining executive roles in Reliance. The reorganisation was an effort to prevent two of the failings that hit many Indian companies once they pass from the control of the founding entrepreneur. The companies are often run as highly personalised fiefdoms by the original patriarch, who holds most of the decision-making powers and delegates little to managers, mixes personal and corporate finances, and requires a high level of sycophancy from employees.
>
> When the empire passes on to two or more pampered sons, frictions are almost inevitable, and usually the only solution is a split of assets and businesses. In some cases this is relatively amicable, as with the children and grandchildren of G. D. Birla. In others it is bitter, as with the Modi brothers and cousins, and requires intervention by the big banks and financial institutions that may have investments or loans with the group. The result is a plethora of groups holding the same family name, distinguished by the initials of the particular owner. The other failing is a consequence of continuing this personalised leadership---a lack of professionalism throughout the organisation and weak systems of financial and operational control.
>
> In a diverse conglomerate like the original Birla or Modi groups, a split can be beneficial. In a highly integrated company like Reliance it could be disastrous. To all appearances, Dhirubhai’s succession plan looked free of immediate trouble. The two sons had never shown any sign of dispute or dissatisfaction with their positions at Reliance. Reserved, and deceptively mild in appearance, Mukesh was regarded as highly determined and even ruthless by acquaintances, as well as being a talented engineer and manager. Anil was more the public face of Reliance, talking to the press and investors. Either individually or put together, however, the two sons seemed unlikely to display all the attributes of Dhirubhai, especially s genius for forging personal relationships at A levels and, perhaps, his boldness of vision.

> According to sources close to the Mehtas, Dhirubhai had been the first person Harshad Mehta had contacted when put on the spot by the State Bank. The Mehtas later came to assert privately that Reliance had been the cause of their downfall, bringing them to the attention of the tax authorities, Venkitaramanan and then the press. The whole securities scam was an exercise to eliminate us, but like putting ink on a blotting paper it could not be contained,’ a source close to the Mehta brothers claims. It is hard to believe this, given that Reliance was still more than two weeks away from its GDR issue when the scam blew open on 23 April 1992, and that Harshad Mehta had been a key operator jacking up the Reliance share price. Nor does it reconcile with the pressure put on Pherwani to pull Harshad out of the soup. The links between Reliance and Harshad Mehta or other brokers were never made explicit throughout the entire investigation, though the favours shown to Reliance by several banks were criticised in the parliamentary committee’s report.

---
> Reliance emerged from the duplicate share and share-switching crisis without substantial penalty. The compounding of the various charges reduced the scandal to a series of admitted technical offences against the Companies Act. The delay in the six-month suspension of its share registry allowed Reliance to inoculate itself by placing the major portion of its issued shares with the new independent share depository opened in Bombay at the end of 1996 and find a new registry for the rest. The stock thus remained tradable and liquid throughout the suspension, and Reliance could claim virtue from taking the lead in using this long-overdue facility to protect investors. But the corporate myth of Reliance Industries had been cracked.
