#### A Festival Of Memory
> Pierre Bourdieu conceptualises ***cultural capital*** as a form of power beyond the economic form, exercised through various non-economic means. The arrival of brahminism reversed all mechanisms of cultural production of the original inhabitants: those parts of their mythology which held the pride of place were made into the antagonistic principle in the Hindu landscape. This robbed subaltern castes of their accumulated cultural capital, immediately relegating them to the bottom of the new hierarchy. The folk tradition having consistently revered Mahabali, it is possible that he was a non-Hindu god before being hijacked into the brahmin myths as happened in the case of many subaltern deities. By floating the Vamana Jayanthi theory, brahminism seeks to rob the Subalterns of what remains of their cultural capital.

> Onam falls in the Malayalam month of Chingam (August-September.). Onam The previous month, *Karkitakam*, is marked by shortages. Even so, preparations and the excitement of anticipation is very much in the air. After *Karkitakam*, the granaries are full and people are afforded a holiday. The appearance of the *Attham* asterism, which is accompanied by the *Athachamayam* procession n Trippunithura off Kochi, marks Onam proper as only ten days away. In some other parts of the state, the subdued merriments in the days that follow *Attham*, reach a crescendo on *Tiruvonam* tapering off in the following days. The main celebrations are on the asterism of *Shravana*. The word Onam perhaps comes from *Shravanam*.

---
> Onam finds mention in Sangam classics like _Mathuraikanchi_, There are references to the festival in Austrian missionary, Paolino da San Barthalomeo's _A Voyage to the East Indies_, an account of his journey through India between 1776 and 1789 CE. A celebration in honour of Mayan, a Dravidian god who became Vishnu in the wake of Aryan arrival, was marked with feasts where meat was not taboo.

---
> You will find *Trikkakkarappans*, 'lords of Trikkakkara' made of soiled mud, in the courtyards of homes during Onam. KT. Ravivarma (2001) says Trikkakkara was originally Tiru-kal-karai, translatable as land of (Vamana's) three holy feet.

---
> The first vague reference to the Bali myth appears in the Rig Veda, the earliest of the tour Vedas, produced around 1500 BCE. In the Rig Veda, however, there is neither Vamana nor Bali. As Indra's sidekick, it is Vishnu himself who takes the three giant steps, creating three worlds because the population had multiplied and the people needed fresh pastures and land for habitation. Thus, the objective behind his action seems to be the welfare of the people and prosperity-not elimination of asuras. The proverbial animus between devas and asuras was still far away. The three steps he took earned Vishnu the name *Trivikrama*. Later, in the Brahmanas (1000-600 BCE) the Dwarf boy is introduced, but he is Vishnu in disguise and not an avatar. Here Vamana takes the three steps and defeats the asuras to seize land for the gods, but once again there is no mention oF Bali. It is in the Mahabharata that for the first time we come across Vishnu's dwarf avatar doing a 'trivikrama' to usurp the asura emperor's kingdom.

#### From Primitive Communism to Landlordism
>  ...projections into the past often widely missed the mark and led to much grand standing, with claims like there was no gender discrimination there was no exploitation ... all were happy.' Not only are such 'truths' hard to ascertain, one can be fairly certain that they are untrue. Nevertheless, the point Marx was trying to make by historicising class relations was to locate the emergence of surplus production. On one level, it is undeniably true that a surplus of commodities wasn't produced by communities of the distant past who could produce just enough for their immediate needs. Capital's need to reproduce itself by draining every ounce of surplus value from commodities was a tendency that evolved with time, and which was provably exploitative and unnecessary. The point was to change this dynamic by revealing its contingency in history and to demystify its hold on our imagination as necessary.

---
> Change in the nature of forces of production is fertile ground for the proliferation of inequality, despotism and of course foreign occupation. Vamana's three steps then symbolise the first act of primitive accumulation in India, an act of appropriation of communally owned property to benefit a handful. It is doubtful that the primitive, egalitarian society we like to imagine would have sustained itself in the absence of an external onslaught. That internal contradictions were already too large within its fold is probably true. Nevertheless, it was an outside force that as instrumental in the collapse of the Maveli paradigm leading to 'social reorganisation', the particular aspects of subjugation that evolved can undeniably be attributed to this invading force, of brahmin domination and sacral caste hierarchy.

---
> There is a tendency to look for a chronological sequence in the story of avatars. How could Maveli rule over Kerala and be overthrown by Vamana, the fifth avatar of Vishnu, if the land was created, as the myth says, from the sea by Parashurama, a later-sixth-avatar? There are other contradictions too. How could Krishna and Balarama be Vishnu's avatars and contemporaries? In the Ramayana, Parashuramna confronts Rama when he breaks king Janaka's bow, and both Ramas are Vishnu avatars!

---
> The Parashurama myth, however, reveals the material underpinnings of changes in society. The fib gave a divine aura to the land-owning brahmin, whose position in the agrarian economy remained largely unchallenged for centuries.

---
> The Aryans first came Vidarbha from where sage Agastya, along with the king of Nidarbha, led a humungous contingent of brahmins to what is now Tamil Nadu. Brahmins in Kerala swear by Parashurama, while Agastya is a popular icon of their Tamil counterparts. The period from the ninth century CE to the early decades of the twelfth, the era of the Chera kingdom of Perumals with their capital at Mahodayapuram, saw the stabilisation of brahmin power and hegemony. In the absence of a sound administrative set-up and strong reserve army,Chera suzerainty over local rulers was limited and they were subject to the whims of the Pandyas and the Cholas.

---
> Buddhist viharas and pre-Aryan *kavus* got converted nto temples. Many mega shrines like those in Sucheendram, Thiruvananthapuram, Thiruvanchiyur, Ettumanur and Thrissivaperur (Thrissur) were built in the eighth century. Land oners and the common people funded the construction of the shrines, but their management was in the hands of committees consisting mostly of brahmin *uralar* (landlords). Brahmins alone could consecrate deities and perform puja. This remained the rule for the next many centuries.

---
> The historian Kesavan Veluthat argues that "The temple developed as the hub around which activities of production and distribution revolved; it was the temple that decided the pattern in which the institution of caste evolved and got congealed...The temple even developed into a centre of political activity, both as a semi-autonomous entity within the territory of a local chieftain and also as the points behind which the different locality chiefs rallied. In short, the temple, which was the nucleus of the Brahmana settlement, functioned as the agency which transformed the way of life in Kerala--in terms of economy, society and polity' (Veluthat 2013). The period from the ninth century to the eighteenth was the golden age of temples, as they grew in prominence dwarfing even the state in its political importance. Only in the eighteenth century did Martanda Varma, the king of Travancore, and Sakthan Thampuran, the ruler of Cochin, attempt to rein in the temples. Control over the temples enabled the brahmins to acquire vast tracts of land.

---
> For nearly two centuries preceding the regime of Marthanda Varma the Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram as managed by an outfit called *Ettarayogam*, *ettara* meaning eight anda half, eight brahmins and one nair.

---
> Entitlement to land gifts, known as brahmadeya, and control over religion became commonplace for brahmins and these privileges had the putative sanction of the scriptures. The myth about Parashurama's land gifts symbolised the donation of huge estates of land and villages by the Chalukyas, Pallavas and Kadambas to brahmins. Believing that a brahmin's blessing brought divine grace, the rulers brought over brahmin families from distant lands and donated sprawling estates to them for performing yajnas

---
> It was not entirely by non-violent means that brahmin power expanded in South India. There is a reference in Keralopatti to Parashurama presenting weapons to thirty-six-thousand brahmins to protect Kerala. These brahmins from ten villages came to be known as 'ardhabrahmanas' and 'shastrabrahmanas'. They were exempted from the studv the Vedas.

---
> The inextricable link between caste and land ownership cannot be ignored. Scholar Pradeepan Pampirikkunnu thinks landlordism was built on caste-based production relations and not the other way round. The chronicler of the dalit movement Sunny M. Kapikkad argues that since the nexus between caste and land ownership was ignored, land reforms in Kerala became, in effect, anti-dalit.

---
> The British held up caste as the lynchpin of Indian society. The colonial masters thought the brahmins with their knowledge of the scriptures were their best possible intermediaries in this country and internalised the stereotype of the other sections of the colonised being at the bottom in the caste hierarchy.

---
> The namboodiris grew rapidly into a community of revered priests. Variers, Marars and Poduvals are among the social groups attached to temples, although not as priests. Nairs, though free of distance taboos, were to serve the namboodiris, but were not allowed physical contact. Ezhavas were to maintain a distance of sixteen feet from nairs and namboodiris, pulayas thirty-two feet from ezhavas and nayadis thirty-two feet from ulayas. This distance rule got the stamp of approval at the gret Mamamkam, an extravagent religious fair, much like the North Indian Kumbh Mela. which used to be held at Tirunavai once in twelve years

---
> Between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the namboodiris shaped a new code known as *Lakhudharma Prakashika* or *Saankarasmriti* which was more regressive and patriarchal than Ven the Manusmriti. Since Sankara lived centuries before this Sanskrit work was penned, there is no reason to attribute this opus, as some people do, to the acharya of advaita. The author of *Saankarasmriti* was, presumably, some obscure Sankaran Namboodiri who was a Parashurama devotee.

---
> What is being described as brahminism is not linked solely to the brahmins. 'Brahminism is the very negation of the spirit of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity' wrote Ambedkar in his seminal work Annihilation of Caste. 
>
> 'Brahminism is practised not just by the brahmin against the kshatriya or the vaishya against the shudra, or the shudra against the untouchable, but also by the untouchable against the unapproachable, the unapproachable against the unseeable. It means there is a quotient of brahminism in everybody regardless of which caste they belong to,’ says Arundhati Roy in her book The Doctor and the Saint.
---

#### The Great Sacrificer
> Indeed, the Vamana-led insurrection led to a decline ot all that was noble. Incidentally, other avatars of Vishnu too have cared two hoots about ethical conduct. Rama killed Sambuka, a shudra, for performing Vedic austerities and killed Sugriva's brother Baali who had done him no harm. In the Kurukshetra battlefield Krishna advised Arjuna to kill Karna, when the latter, unarmed, was fixing the wheel of his war-chariot. Violating the rules of war, Bheema struck Duryodhana on the thigh, again on a signal from Krishna. The repeated appearances of Vishnu merely seem to be in order to help spur the immoral actions of immoral people along.

---
> Was Mahabali a historical figure? There are striking similarities between Bali and Ashoka, the Mauryan emperor who ruled over North India for forty-one long years from 273 to 232 BCE. Both Ashoka and Mahabali belonged to the shramana tradition; both rejected chaturvarnya and both earned the odium of the priestly class. Ambedkar has underscored the fact that the Mauryans were the only shudra dynasty to reach the top ruling echelons in India, This dynasty was also brought down by the machinations of the brahmin general, Pushyamitra Sunga, who ushered in an age of brahminical revivalism.

---
> Maharashtra's Baliraja The Bali myth runs deep in subaltern social memory outside Kerala too. In the Maratha region, Maveli of the Malayali is Bali or Baliraja. While the people of the North invoke Ram Raiva, Keralites fantasise about Mavelinadu where an egalitarian society is believed to have flourished, where there are no taxes or harassment, classless and casteless and is an urban center unlike the utopian rural Ram Rajya of Gandhi's dreams. According to Phule, Baliraja's kingdom included Maharashtra, parts of the Konkan and the Malwal regions and some near Lanka. A shudratishudra ruler. Bali led the origina inhabitants of India, the Dravidians. Vamana was the chief leadet of the Vipras. The anti-caste crusader was actively subverting the brabminical structure of ideas and beliefs so that a new, more equitable order could emerge. Phule was not writing history. He was rewriting brahminícal 'history' from a shudratishudra perspective.

---
#### Mahabali's Tribe

> The Rig Veda does not consistently show the asuras and devas as sparring partners; the asuras are frequently referred to with respect. They were not simply seen as evil demons back then. Indra and Varuna, the war and sea gods respectively, were mentioned as asuras as was the dark complexioned Krishna

--- 
> B.R. Ambedkar is of the view that asuras and devas, rakshsas, rashasis and gandharvas were all ordinary people. It was the brahmins who had them transformed into strange creatures, investing them with unusual characteristics in order to maintain cultural domination.

---
> The gonds believe that Ravana was their king. They deny being Hindus and also dispute the conventional idea about the geographical location of Bovana's Lanka. Lanka lay in the Amarkantak mountain region of Madhya Pradesh, they say, not in the Indian Ocean. In Gondi, Lanka' denotes a hilly place For them, Rama was an antagonistic figure who camne to the rescue of the yajna-obsessed brahmin holy men whose rituals involving fire polluted the air and disturbed peace and tranquillity in the homeland of the non-Aryan adivasis.

---
#### People's Gods and Goddesses
> First, the rituals and liturgical rites observed in Kerala have not been influenced by those of the Aryavrata tradition and are observably separate. And second, the mythologies peddled by Hinduism don't have much import on the Malayali consciousness the premier deity of puranic Hinduism, the Ayodhyan prince Rama, is hardly ever worshipped. Nor do people in Kerala celebrate Diwali, a festival in memory of the triumph of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana over the asura king, Ravana.

---
> Krishna, to begin with, was an asura, an adivasi clan leader, and an opponent of the Aryans who even confronted Indra. The apotheosis of Krishna is s a later development.

---
> An example of a folk deity who was later appropriated by an insurgent brahminism was the goddess of war, Kottavai, said to be an antecedent of Kali and Bhadrakali.

---
> Another case of what may be ancestor worship, or affection for an anti-hero, is the deification of Suyodhana. the eldest Kaurava prince whom his enemies called Duryodhana. The traditional owners of the shrine believe that the place was once visited by Suyodhana, whom they fondly call Malanada Appooppan, the grandfather of the hills. There is a subsidiary shrine of Gandhari, Suyodhana's mother.

---
> Many sacred groves have been sucked in by Hinduism, not only in Kerala but also in neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Deities made of sand and lime have been replaced by granite ones that do not dissolve in the abhishekam water. Uncovered sacred groves of mother goddesses have been Aryanised and have become Hindu kshetrams of Kali, Durga or Bhagavati, with their upper caste priests and tantris.

---
> Is Ayyappa a Hindu god? He is a total stranger to North Indian Hinduism. The only puranic work in which Ayyappa finds mention is the nineteenth century Bhoothanatopakhyanam. He is treated as a Hindu deity although you look in vain for a god with that name in the Hindu pantheon. The shrine has a strong plebian connection and is outside the Hindu tantric modality. 'Sabarimala', which means Sabari's hill or mountain, got the namne from an adivasi woman, a character in the Ramayana. The very name 'Ayyappa' has a subaltert ring to it. Nor is the identity of his lieutenants in sub-shrines any different--Kochu Kadutha, Valiya Kadutha, Karuppa Swamy, Karuppayi Amma. The Mala Arayans allege that the Tazhamon tantris grabbed the shrine from them. The name of Karimala Arayan, who was the first priest of the temple, can be found embossed on the first of the eighteen holy steps leading to the shrine, it is said. Since 1902 the tantris have been managing the puja and related matters.

---
> The Ayyappa cult is a fascinating study in syncretism, Th myth is also the story of young Ayyappa's close camaraderie with the Muslim warrior, Vavar, and the Christian priest, Veluthachan. Such a multi-religious association is unimaginable in aHindu dispensation. However, the austere place is generally considered a Hindu temple. The pilgrimage has a Buddhist flavour. Perhaps Ayyappa was a Buddhist holy man, if not the Budha himsell Or maybe Ayyappa and his friends were originally tribal god who were taken over by Buddhism. It is possible that the accen n austere, sanyasi life and camaraderie and the absence of cast differences and untouchability point to the Buddhist ongn at the pilgrimage to the hill shrine. Do the repeated 'sharanan' chants not ring a Buddhist bell? Does the pilgrim's renunciation of the comforts of life during the pilgrimage not remind you of Gautama's own renunciation? The sitting posture of the deity in Sabarimala has striking similarities wth the motif of the meditating Buddha. Ayyappa seems to be the deity of one of the many viharas and deities of Mahayana Buddhism whích brahminism is known to have appropriated Ayyappa is also known as Dharma Shasta. Dharma' (dhamma in Pali) figures prominently in the Buddhist lexicon and Shasta is another name for the Buddha. There is a relevant parallel in Buddhist religious life to the bar on adult women in Sabarimala

---
> The teyyams are a political phenomnenon and Pottan is the most political of themhe challenges Adi Sankara, the brahmin acharya of advaita who also belonged to Kerala. Pottan Teyyam employs the very weapon of advaita--non duality, the oneness of being-against the proponent of that philosophical system. The philosopher realises his mistake and prostrates before thhe chandala who in turn blesses him. In the Hinduised version of the Sankara-Pottan face-off, the dalit disappears and in his place appears Lord Siva who blesses Sankara. The parayan VICtim of the caste system who advances solid arguments against caste is erased.  Like Ayyappa who admits all devotees without any distinction of caste, creed or class, teyyams do not respect the received brahminical wisdom on caste hierarchies. The revolutionary tradition of teyyam is too obvious to be ignored. The traditional mask dance of the dalits became a means to rebuke, ridicule and question the atrocities and injustices done to them For the dalits, teyyam is a weapon in the struggle against the unjust social system that has marginalised them.

---
> Mutthappa, whose main shrine, called Madappura, is in Parassinikkadavu on the banks of the Valapattanam river in Kannur district. Most priests come from the lower rungs of the caste hierarchy, while Mutthappa teyyams are enacted by dalits. As in the case of Ayyappa, equality among the devotees is the norm in the Mutthappa cult. Hindus would keep off the Madappura, which represented the ideology of lower caste revolt against brahmin culture and hegemony in Kerala. These days, savarna houscholders te come and pour out their woes before Mutthappa Today concerted efforts are under way to Hinduise Mutthappa. 1avisu In the past, caste perhaps, the cultural complexion of the shrine has undergone a transformation as Mutthappa is being gentrified and co-opted into the fold of Aryan deities rituals, G Inevitably The worst Lord Siva. The Madappura now displays the board kshetram" which word is normally used to describe a Hindu place of Worship and relies on namboodiris for the performance of some claims that Mutthappa is a dalit incarnation of part of the story is that members of the pulayan and other dalit communities are not allowed into the temple. Swami Anandathirthan, a radical social reformer who was a close disciple of the oppressed caste icon, Sree Narayana Guru, was roughed up when he tried to enter the Madappura in Parassinikkadavu along with a few lower caste children.

--- 
#### Buddha's Kin
> Padmanabha Palpu opines that the killing of kshatriyas recounted in the Parashurama myth was a displaced sign of the violent killing of Buddhists on the Kerala coast.

---
> Buddhist monks set up many viharas which provided free education to people belonging to every caste and religion. The Buddhists thus laid in Kerala the foundation of a sound system of education, on which Christian missionaries built later. The bulk of the Buddhists got absorbed into Hinduism at the bottom of the hierarchical scale. However, exception was made in the case of some scholars who were useful for the new Social order. For example, those who were experts in medicine were given the sacred thread and brahminised; they are today's illustrious Ayurvedic physicians.

---
> There was a Jain shrine in Paruvassery in Thrissur which later got converted into a Vishnu temple. The roots of the temples in Kallil near Perumbavoor and Chitral near Kuzhithura go deep into Jainism. Bharata of the Kamayana is claimed to be the presiding deity in the well known Koodalmanikyan temple in Irinjalakkuda, but this was yet another case of gentrification. Many scholars identify the deity here with Jain monk Bharateswaran. The vegetarianism of upper caste Hindus is possibly a Jain legacy. The three-feet-tall Karumatikkuttan statue built in the eighth century in Ambalappuzha taluk in southern Kerala is believed to be the Buddha. he Buddha statues found in Mavelikkara, Bharanikkavu, Ambalappuzha, P Pallippuram and elsewhere in South Kerala provide solid evidence of Kerala's Buddhist ancestry

---
> Against the backdrop of the spread of Buddhism that contributed immensely to Kerala's culture, it is possible that a that Buddhist devotee did rule over Kerala in the distant past, Mahabali was an ardent Buddhist who ruled at a time when the non-theistic faith reigned supreme in the spiritual and social Iife of the Malayali. Many scholars believe that the myth abou the fall of Mahabali and the rise of Vamana represents the story of the snuffing out of Buddhism from Kerala where the rational shramanic faith flourished for well over a millennium. 

---
> Following the schism in the faith and the triumph of the Mahayana creed, however, Buddhism had its radical teeth pulled out and it ceased to be a rational system. Mahayana Buddhists believe in gods and regard the Buddha as the greatest among them. There are elaborate ceremonies and rituals. Since the puranas were an attempt to boost brahminic Hinduism, it is no wonder that the Mahabharata and the Vishnu Purana, among other works, listed the Buddha, whose influence spread even outside India, as one of the avatars of Vishnu. The revolutionary role that he plaved in Indian social life was completely ignored.

---
> The Buddha was a free-thinker and democrat he told his disciples not to believe anything merely because it is traditional, but because they themselves have imagined it, to not believe what he teacher tells them merely out of respect for him. Whatsoever, after due examination and analysis, is found to be conducive to the good, for the benefit, the welfare of all beings believe and cling to that doctrine, and take it as your guide. The karma theory which he preached was unabashedly this-worldly, far different from what the Vedic religion trotted out. Buddhism was a great religion if by that term we mean an earnest search for truth. It was not a religion in the conventional sense as the Buddha debunked the very idea of an almighty god. The insistence on a social ethic without religious underpinnings distinguished early Buddhism from formal religions

--- 
> Ambedkar traced the origin of untouchability to the Buddhists' refusal to revere the brahmins and the latter's consequent hatred for the Buddhists. Around 600 BCE, the Vedic religion with its yajnas and other wasteful and exploitative rituals faced a strong challenge from radical kshatriyas in eastern India. The birth of Buddhism and Jainisn had its origin in the disillusionment of the kshatriyas with unproductive brahminism.
