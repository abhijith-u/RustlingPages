## 1. The ABCs of Socialism  
*Various Authors (Edited Compilation)*

### Key Ideas (Summary)
- Socialism is fundamentally about democratic control over the economy and society, focusing on meeting human needs and fostering genuine political and economic freedom.  
- Capitalism structurally generates inequality, exploitation, and systemic oppression along lines of class, race, gender, and more.  
- Common misconceptions, such as socialism being anti-democratic or inherently authoritarian, are refuted with historical and theoretical evidence.  
- Socialism insists on tackling interconnected oppressions (intersectionality) including racism and sexism alongside class struggle.  
- Redistribution through progressive taxation is justified since wealth is socially created, and redistribution expands freedom.  
- Socialism promotes creativity, cultural vibrancy, and collective human flourishing rather than uniformity or boredom.  
- Revolutionary change requires mass popular mobilization and cannot be achieved by gradual reforms alone.

## 14. You Are Not So Smart  
*David McRaney*

### Key Ideas (Summary)

- Recognizing cognitive biases and mental short-cuts is crucial to understanding human fallibility.  
- Increased awareness of these blind spots can improve decision-making and self-understanding.  
- This work highlights the limits of introspection and the complexity of human cognition.
