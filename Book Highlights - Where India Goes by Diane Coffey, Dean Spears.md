[Where India Goes by Diane Coffey, Dean Spears](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35700469-where-india-goes)

#### Introduction

- Infant mortality in India is about 20 per cent higher than the international trend predicts for a country with India’s GDP per capita
- India’s record of human development – that is, of health, education and freedom to choose a good life – lags far behind the quality of life offered by many poorer countries.
- Political theorists have long recognized that nationalism always requires a little bit of fiction and forgetfulness of historical facts. In the era of big data, perhaps this maxim requires elaboration: Nationalism now also requires failing to collect, tabulate or understand statistics.
- The political right characteristically responds to this story by saying that what is needed is more economic growth. By continuing to pursue economic growth, the country’s markets will eventually improve India’s abysmal health and education indicators. The political left sees India’s human development indicators as justification for a strong welfare state. If Indians are suffering worse outcomes than are evidently economically feasible, the state should step in to deliver public goods and private benefits.
- Poor sanitation persists in rural India because of unique social forces – in particular, caste. Many people look forward to a modern, prosperous India. But it may not be possible to accelerate India’s future without engaging with the illiberal forces of caste and untouchability that are still part of India’s present. Open defecation in rural India is a globally special case that helps us understand how social inequality constrains human development.
- Open Defecation - 13 per cent of the world’s population disposes of its faeces in this dangerous way. 2011 census, which found that 53 per cent of Indian households had no toilet or latrine and did not use a public toilet. Many people in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of Asia who are far poorer than the average rural Indian nevertheless use a toilet or latrine. According to the 2012 UNICEF and WHO Joint Monitoring Report, only a quarter of households in sub-Saharan Africa defecate in the open
- Villagers are not aware that open defecation kills children and so they have no reason to electorally punish their local councils for failing to make their neighbours use latrines. ==In villagers’ minds, open defecation is a far superior choice to storing faeces in a government-provided latrine pit that would need to be emptied by hand, an activity which invokes a generations-old struggle between people who are still too often thought of as ‘Untouchables’ and those who still too often exploit, exclude and humiliate them.==
- The rural sanitation programmes of the Indian state ignore opportunities to gather useful information on how many Indians defecate in the open and obfuscate this fact with intricate webpages that claim to track construction funds.

#### The puzzle: Why rural India?

- water scarcity cannot explain India’s high rates of open defecation. This is unfortunate. If water were the culprit, the problem would perhaps be much easier to solve. The truth is that it takes very little water to use an inexpensive latrine.
- Many latrines in rural Africa do not have a water seal, and so they do not need to be flushed. These latrines are an improvement over open defecation if the holes are covered. Despite this, households in rural India very rarely build latrines without water seals, and so the latrines that are found in rural India require more water for flushing.
- Open defecation in India is not merely a problem of lack of access to latrines. Despite the failures of the Total Sanitation Campaign, the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, launched in 2012, was a brief, nearly identical programme. The biggest difference was that the government announced that it would spend more money to build each latrine than it had under the TSC

#### Purity, pollution and untouchability

- How does a higher-caste Hindu in a village in north India conceive of cleanliness, dirtiness, purity and pollution? Part of what make the concepts of purity and pollution so important for understanding life in India is that they are core concepts of the caste system
- Ideas about purity and pollution are often used to justify why some castes are ranked higher than others. People from higher castes are thought to be inherently more pure than people from lower castes, and they often try to behave in ways that reinforce this idea.
- In some situations, lower-caste people are believed to pollute higher-caste people, but in other situations they are required to absorb or clean up pollution that might befall a higher-caste person, in order to make him or her pure again
- It is not that Dhobi women get clothes physically cleaner. Instead, they absorb the pollution of childbirth in a public way so that Fatima’s daughter-in-law – indeed, the whole family – can be absolved of the ritual impurity of childbirth
- Purity and pollution rules have little to do with germs and much to do with enforcing subordination of lower-caste people
- The litter problem plaguing Indian cities is not only about people not caring what happens to public spaces but also about caste politics. Indians throw their trash on the ground not merely out of laziness but also to assert their superiority over Dalits. It is, after all, Dalits who are expected to clean public places
- One way that members of one caste may try to assert their superiority over another is by adopting more stringent purity and pollution restrictions. For instance, members of upwardly mobile castes often adopt dietary practices that are seen as pure, such as vegetarianism and avoiding alcohol. M.N. Srinivas famously termed this process ‘sanskritization’

#### Latrine pits and slow social change

- untouchability is about far more than the physical unpleasantness of performing certain kinds of work. It is about a social and economic system that exploits, excludes and humiliates some people and privileges others.
- In other developing countries, where untouchability and manual scavenging never existed, emptying latrine pits is a job done by people who are poor and down on their luck. But they are not people whose parents were prevented from drawing water from a well. They are not people whose parents were forced to eat scraps after public functions. In other countries, emptying latrine pits is an unpleasant job rather than a symbol of generations of oppression and humiliation.
- The key reason why people who empty latrine pits can charge much more than the prevailing wage for day labour is that very, very few people are willing to do this work, even for high wages.
- Having talked to many villagers himself, the field manager understood that people did not want government latrines because they did not want to deal with having to empty latrine pits. He wondered if more people would adopt latrines if he were also able to offer a pit-emptying service. But he struggled to find people to provide those services

#### Health: Surviving and growing in childhood

- economists Sonia Bhalotra, Christine Valente and Arthur van Soest. Using the Indian government’s National Family Health Survey data, they documented that Muslim babies in India are more likely than Hindu babies in India to survive childhood.
- The fraction of a village or neighbourhood that defecates in the open may offer a far better measure of a child’s exposure to disease in the environment than simply whether his own parents own a toilet.
- If so, the role of religion in Indian society would become important. Muslims tend to live near other Muslims and Hindus tend to live near other Hindus. In combination with the fact that Muslims are less likely to defecate in the open, this adds up to a large difference in babies’ disease environments
- Hindu babies who live in villages where they are surrounded by many Muslims are just as likely to survive as Muslim babies with the same fraction of Muslim neighbours.
- Once children were matched so that there was no Hindu–Muslim difference in exposure to open defecation, they found that there was no Hindu–Muslim difference in mortality either: Babies of either religion were similarly likely to die at the same level of neighbourhood sanitation. So, neighbourhood sanitation can account for the Muslim mortality paradox
 
#### Economics: Children’s human capital, adults’ wages

- one important measure of the economic health of a country is the health of its babies. By moving beyond the familiar GDP, poverty and savings rates, economists have ultimately learnt that infant mortality and child height deserved a place among the important economic indicators all along.
- In the new empirical economics of human capital, the height of our physical bodies has emerged as an especially important measure
- We have seen that open defecation makes children shorter; that shorter children perform worse on cognitive tests; and that reducing open defecation can improve child learning. In other countries and other situations, economists have detected effects of early-life health and disease on adult earnings. All this evidence points in the same direction: Early-life exposure to open defecation is likely to reduce the productivity of adult workers and impact the wages they earn

#### Dignity: The people who want latrines

- Considering how restricted the movement of women is in rural India, it was no surprise to us that many women reported enjoying the temporary freedom and sociality that open defecation provides.
- The facts that many women in rural India face severe restrictions on their freedom of movement and that many women associate open defecation with freedom stand in stark contrast to the patriarchal messages that the government uses to encourage men to invest in latrines.
- Economists characteristically recommend public policies that cause a Pareto improvement – meaning policies that make some people better off without making anyone worse off – even if they increase inequality. But to apply this idea successfully, you must be very sure that, say, a rich person becoming richer does not make the poor worse off. For example, one way that economists typically think the poor might be made worse off by the rich getting richer, even if there is no change in their own wealth, is if increased inequality in society undermines democratic accountability for everyone.

#### Policy: Politics, development and latrine construction

- Governance, we wrote, has not been a solution to open defecation in rural India, but nor is it to blame. We reiterate this here: Many countries with worse governance than India have much less rural open defecation.
- the hypothesis that the power of the Indian state over rural open defecation is limited, in part because the state lacks the human resources needed for behaviour change, and in part because the social forces against it are strong.
- the state appears active, not limited, with programmes everywhere, meetings about everything and written guidelines for every goal. However, the policymaking activity that accompanies an outcome is not sufficient to conclude that the activity caused the outcome
- What we need is a sanitation sena – an army of frontline workers, one in every village, responsible solely for motivating and sustaining latrine use
- Yet, existing health and community workers have little reason to take up the task of convincing people to use latrines when they will not be compensated for doing so. And despite the fact that sanitation experts agree that the government should put greater emphasis on behaviour change than latrine construction, the government has not allocated funds to hire a staff for this purpose. Behaviour change is nobody’s job. It is no wonder, then, that the programme guidelines never precisely specify who will do this work
- Not only does the Swachh Bharat Mission, unlike other social programmes such as the Integrated Child Development Scheme or the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, not provide for the much-needed staff; worse still, its guidelines limit the amount that can be spent on ‘Information, Education and Communication (IEC)’. The guidelines specify that no more than 8 per cent of the overall budget can be spent on IEC. The amount that is in fact spent on behaviour change is even less than this: In 2016–17, Accountability Initiative found that only about 1 per cent of the Swachh Bharat Mission budget was spent on trying to convince people to use latrines
- When the government adopts a new policy or expands funding for an existing one, it makes sense to ask who is pushing for the change. For example, programmes that redistribute resources to the rural poor are often seen as an attempt to buy rural votes. In this case, many rural households will be receiving something from the SBM. Yet, rural voters cannot be the political interest group responsible for the SBM. As we have seen, rural Indians have little demand for the kind of latrines the government gives away. Nor do they have any demand for sanitation behaviour – change programmes: It is precisely rural voters’ behaviour that must change if open defecation is to end. As useful as it would be, there is no reason to expect the large majority of rural Indians who defecate in the open to rise up at the polls and demand that the government figure out some way to make them stop
- What the political right objects to as ‘entitlements’, the left pushes for as ‘rights’
- sanitation policy should be designed around the constraints on affordable latrine adoption imposed by caste, untouchability and social attitudes. Yet, people on the extreme cultural right have no objection to caste hierarchy and the remnants of untouchability, and people on the extreme economic left have no patience for such social details. The furthest left in India perceives a world of class conflict: Many reject Dalit struggles against caste hierarchy as a distraction from the ultimate goal of mobilizing a unified working class. So, they too are unlikely to set aside their core values for a nuanced, pragmatic position on sanitation. The battle between left and right never meets in the middle to evaluate the utilitarian, statistical evidence that open defecation causes externalities that have a surprisingly large effect on health and well-being
- the India Human Development Survey asked respondents whether they practise untouchability. Fully 16 per cent of urban household respondents who classified themselves as Brahmin or forward caste admitted to the surveyor – a perfect stranger – that someone in their household practises untouchability. Education alone is unlikely to eliminate the problem: This fraction rises slightly to 18 per cent among urban Brahmin households where an adult has completed secondary school. To emphasize, this is not a subtle detection of implicitly biased behaviour. On the contrary, these respondents were prepared to confess openly to practising untouchability in a face-to-face survey.
- rural political elites do have a substantial interest in a large, active rural sanitation programme. But the kind of programme they are interested in is not one that will convince people to build their own simple latrines, use them and empty the pit. Rather, they are interested in the kind of programme that we already have, one in which funds can be siphoned off from construction budgets and into their own pockets.
- By the early 2000s, the Washington Consensus had become an emblem of what many saw as wrong with international development: Uniform policies undifferentiated by country or population, to the apparent benefit of global economic elites. An anti-globalization movement emerged and raised some of the same good questions as anti-colonial movements before them: Who put rich countries in charge of the poor? Why should democratic governments, elected by poor people, not be allowed to govern themselves? Who is being served?

#### Conclusion: The next rural sanitation policy

- One consequence of this technocratic spirit is that it is easy to believe that all public problems are ultimately management problems, rather than political or social problems. With the right analytics and the right tools, there is nothing we cannot expect to accomplish promptly. Policymakers today do not know less than policymakers a generation ago, but they may feel like they know more than they do
- Recommendation 2: Talk about culture, choices and caste - It misdiagnoses open defecation as a problem that can be solved merely by providing toilet parts. That means it distracts us from finding solutions. And, it obscures the humanity of poor people, whose choices are limited by poverty, but not eliminated by it.
- Recommendation 3: Test and modify strategies about pollution and pits - The ideas we would like to see tested are built around the problems of untouchability, purity and pollution, and the misperceptions that latrine pits fill too quickly and cannot be emptied by hand. Here are a few examples:
	- Teach people that latrine pits actually take much longer to fill up than they believe. If people correctly believe it will take years rather than weeks or months, more people might be willing to use the pits in ordinary government latrines.
	- Teach people about affordable twin-pit latrines, including how they work, how often they need to be emptied and why they are a good sanitation option for most places in rural India.
	- Where that fails, consider spending the large latrine construction subsidy on larger pits, rather than on expensive superstructures. This might delay the need for emptying the pit until more people have grown accustomed to latrine use.
	- Find a way to offer convenient and guaranteed methods of emptying latrine pits while ensuring that workers engaged in such jobs use safety gear, are well-compensated and choose such a career freely.
	- Use the imagery of purity and pollution to subvert casteist constraints. Depict high-ranking villagers getting on with emptying a latrine pit safely.
	- Acknowledge the continued existence of manual scavenging and address it in a meaningful way.
	- The government should stop employing people to do work which is outlawed under the 2013 act prohibiting manual scavenging and pay to upgrade outdated urban sanitation and drainage systems. It should prosecute people who hire manual scavengers. It should also clearly make the point that emptying decomposed latrine pits is not manual scavenging.
	- Above all, embrace the problem. Both the government and international development should be vocal about the causes of widespread open defecation in India. Struggling against untouchability is working towards the end of open defecation in India, and vice versa.
