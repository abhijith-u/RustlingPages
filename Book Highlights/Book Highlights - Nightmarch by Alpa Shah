- Perhaps one of the main reasons why Maoism as an idea spread widely across much of the global South in comparison to other forms of leftist social movements was Mao’s theorisation of the role of the peasantry in revolutionary change. Earlier forms of Marxism saw the proletariat—of which the classic image was the dehumanised urban factory worker—as the truly revolutionary class that would usher in a classless society. They regarded the peasantry as reactionary and a force that would disappear from history because they would be uprooted from their land and would eventually join the urban proletariat. Mao turned this received wisdom on its head and argued for revolutionary history to be made by peasants who would lead a war from the countryside. In a context in which mass industrialisation and the formation of a proletariat was absent from the history of many nations, Maoism therefore enabled a vast swathe of the global South to be the potential harbinger of revolutionary social change.

- In addition to this focus on the peasantry, Maoism as an idea was also popular for at least two other reasons.
	- First, Mao saw capitalism as inextricably tied to foreign imperialism and therefore argued that revolutionary change had to be thought of as a worldwide struggle of the forces of socialism against those of imperialism. Mao thus became immediately relevant for many who were fighting colonialism and who either headed anti-colonial movements against the imperial nations or were developing critiques against their own national elites who they argued had allied with colonial forces.
	- Second, Maoism allowed for the translation of a wide range of local conditions and problems through the political, organisational and leadership method which Mao called the ‘mass line’, central to which was consulting with the masses and interpreting and incorporating their suggestions within the revolutionary framework. ‘From the masses to the masses’—as the mass line was referred to—was based on investigating the conditions of people, learning about and participating in their struggles, gathering ideas from them, and creating a plan of action based on their concerns in light of the revolutionary goal. The implication was that Maoism could flourish in discrete ways in different parts of the world, based on local conditions, and with little to do with Maoism elsewhere, or, for that matter, as it existed in China. <br></br>
	Everywhere the high theory of the Indian Maoist analysis of the economy translated on the ground into a fight against inequality and for social justice; the fight against oppression by landlords, against caste discrimination, for labour rights and land rights. Everywhere they sought to mobilise the most marginalised people and demand their dignity be respected and their rights protected.

- Although government programmes, activists and scholars in India often consider Adivasis alongside Dalits as India’s most oppressed and poorest communities, in the hills where Adivasis had some direct access to land and forests, they were not dependent on other groups for their everyday survival in the way that Dalits were in the agricultural plains. This autonomy to sustain themselves on their own terms, though, has come to be persistently undermined.<br></br>
	The British colonial state and the Mughals before them nevertheless wanted revenue from their land as they did across the country. They introduced outsiders—usually higher castes from the plains—to control, ‘tame’ and settle the populations. The newcomers tried various strategies, like forcibly moving the people and resettling them in villages that looked more like those of the plains and indebting them through outside moneylenders, turning them into bonded labourers.<br></br>
From the late nineteenth century, alongside attempts at land settlement and alienation, commercial logging developed when the forests were found to be a rich resource. As the forests became ‘reserved’ or ‘protected’ the forest dwellers were slowly forced into more permanent settlements on the forest fringes. The settlement of the forests also introduced a new population of outsiders who came to work the forests and serve the markets opened by forest harvesting and moneylending.

- Rebellions in various parts of the central and eastern Indian hills arose across the late eighteenth, nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One of the most striking of these rebellions (although not the first) was the Santhal Hul. It in fact began two years before the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny against the British East India Company that is otherwise thought of as India’s First War of Independence. <br></br>
	The rebellion that is perhaps the most well known is that of Birsa Munda in 1899–1901. Birsa’s portrait hangs in the Indian parliament as the only Adivasi to have such an honour. The Birsa movement became a historic marker of Adivasi resistance perhaps because in its aftermath some protective measures were finally put into place. Mediated by Christian missionaries, the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act—often considered the Magna Carta of the Adivasis—was an attempt to stop Adivasi land and forests from being sold off to outsiders so that they wouldn’t simply be turned into abject wage labour.

- Despite the introduction of various such land protection measures—which eventually got enshrined in the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Indian Constitution—these laws have been persistently undermined - the Indian state continued the exploitative legacy of the forests in new ways. From the seventies, after most of the forests had been depleted, the Indian forestry agenda turned from harvesting the forests to protecting them under a new conservation agenda that was taking over the world further curtailing the rights of Adivasis from those forests.<br></br>

	As their access to the resources around them was increasingly restricted, they also migrated seasonally as casual wage labour to do the most gruelling of works. Neither the British Raj nor the Indian state made substantive attempts to develop basic infrastructure for the people who lived in these regions. Efforts to encourage literacy were also negligible and in most of the villages, up to 90 per cent of the Adivasi population was illiterate. Subsequently, they not have enough education to consider applying for the ambitious constitutional provision for jobs in the state sector that were to be reserved for Adivasis and Dalits in proportion to their representation in the total population.<br></br>
	
	Adivasis could maintain their egalitarian countercultures partly because state officials had not taken an interest in co-opting them into their project of citizen-making, but especially because they still had some direct access to the material resources of forests and land, which gave them the autonomy to live on their own terms, and to reproduce their communities and values, without much interference from or being too dependent on others. It was in the lands of these relatively egalitarian communities that the Naxalite leaders found themselves, seeking to nurture their revolutionary struggle for an egalitarian society.


- Indian Maoist structure : The political wing is the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and the millitant wing is the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA). Heading it all, in a pyramidal structure, was the Central Committee with its Politburo overseeing the various State-level Committees that executed the political-organisational work of the movement.<br></br>
	Within each of these Maoist states were Regional Committees, followed by Zonal Committees, under which there were Area Committees overseeing the work of party cells and mass organisations (the latter were non-violent and led by and consisted of people who were not underground). These political structures were supported by the military force of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army. Villagers who wanted to join the armies were first recruited into local area squads. If they lasted, they would be promoted to a platoon (a force of about thirty soldiers), then a company (around eighty to ninety soldiers) and finally a battalion (of several hundred soldiers). Mass fronts were usually kept separate from the armies to protect them as they were open and not underground and therefore more vulnerable to state repression.

- The Indian state’s solution to this growing force was development under the barrel of a gun, The links between the economic growth model of the government and the war to be waged against the Maoists were explicit. The brain behind the offensive which followed, Home Minister P. Chidambaram (also the erstwhile finance minister), was previously a corporate lawyer representing several mining corporations as well as a non-executive director of Vedanta—a British mining company owned by the billionaire Anil Aggarwal—which planned to excavate bauxite in many parts of India.<br></br>
	The most brutal form of counterinsurgency measures began after the 2004–5 ‘peace negotiations’. In the Dandakaranya region of southern Chhattisgarh, to which the Naxalites had retreated after the repression in Andhra Pradesh, from 2006, local youth were armed and mobilised to cleanse the area of people in what was called _Salwa Judum_, meaning ‘purification hunt’ in the local Gondi language. Headed and nurtured by a local politician—who called the mobilisation a ‘Peace March’—the hunt recruited upwardly mobile educated youth from both the middle castes and the Adivasis, and backed by the police and government funding and weapons, they attacked the Adivasi villages and villagers who were seen as Naxalite supporters.

- In the 90s, there had been a major disagreement amongst the Naxalites about the correct interpretation of the Indian economy. It was a question about the extent to which India was ‘semi-feudal’ or ‘capitalist’, and the period went down in Naxalite history as ‘the two-line struggle’.<br></br>

	Was a feudal economy one in which land was colonised by just a rich minority with the rest of the population working for these landowners, partly bonded and indebted to them over generations? Was the presence of people selling their labour for a wage a sufficient condition to say that the economy had transited to a capitalist one, or did farmers also need to be accumulating and investing and reinvesting the surplus they generated from agricultural production to deserve this title for its economy?<br></br>

	How the economy was classified mattered to the guerrillas because it was the basis of the strategy they would use in their war. It determined the extent to which they would work in rural areas, as opposed to the cities. If they analysed the economy to be semi-feudal, they would fight an underground rural war. Whereas if capitalism was concluded to prevail, they would first pursue nonviolent mobilisation using parliamentary elections. I learnt from several people who left the revolutionaries that, in the ‘two-line struggle’ of the late nineties, not only were there internal disagreements about how to analyse the Indian economy, but also that democratic norms of discussion and debate within the party had been flouted. Despite research which showed otherwise, certain powerful leaders maintained that the country was semi-feudal; the analysis remained the same and therefore nothing changed.

- One idea that seemed crucial to keeping alive the dream of an ideal human community was sacrifice. Once seen as a means of appeasing and obliging the gods, by the end of the nineteenth century some scholars said sacrifice was about much more than the giving of gifts to deities. Though considered primarily in religious contexts, sacrifice became seen as a crucial means for people to enter an imagined world that is sacred, that is ‘other-worldly’, and bring its influence to bear in the world of their everyday lives, a world that was prosaic, transient and ordinary. Through this lens, the idea of sacrifice can be a supremely creative force. It enables people to transcend and overcome the ordinary world they live in, to join forces with the imagination of a different world, the world of the extraordinary, in order to create and breathe life from that ideal world into the here and now. People offering themselves in sacrifice can create new solidarities between themselves based on the idea of that extraordinary future world, which in turn would help build the utopian human community of their imagination in the present. Bearing this burden of the baggage bestowed by their privileged backgrounds, cutting ties with their families, crushing their personal histories and destroying their past personas were crucial measures for the Naxalite leaders to engender a new world.<br></br>

	Across the world, most acts of sacrifice take place through symbolic violence—for instance mutilations of the body, the killing of animals, or the consumption of food—where the body part, animal or food is a representation of the human participants making the offering. Such rituals represent people metaphorically crushing their everyday mundane worlds and symbolically killing themselves in order to participate in creating an immortal moral world which conquers, transforms and encompasses the world of the present. A central creative force in sacrifice, this rebounding violence negates the everyday world allowing its participants to reach out to something that surpasses it and then colonises it with the ideas of another world. Not innate to people, this violence is a symptom of their attempt to create a world beyond the one in which their everyday lives are trapped.<br></br>

	Superhuman goals like that striven for by Naxal leaders—the creation of an ideal world with an equal and democratic human community in the here and now—are so set against the values of the everyday world that surrounds them that they come at considerable human cost. The greatest sacrificial force is the giving of human life itself: human sacrifice. When revolutionaries sacrificed themselves and thus the world around them to create a world of their dreams, their death and destruction would regenerate life itself to become creative forces.

- The direct opposite of sacrifice, its antonym, is suicide. Commenting on a friend who had hanged himself from a ceiling fan, Gyanji once scoffed, ‘What an individualistic selfish act! It is for nobody. It does not contribute, create or construct anything. The struggle against self-seeking individualistic thinking is harder than the struggle against the enemy.’ I think that Gyanji saw suicide as the consequence of an individual leaving one moral world but with no other world to create. A place of torment caused by insatiable passions and limitless desires that can never be fulfilled, because there is no creative project to make and contain them.

- That is perhaps why the rituals of martyrdom, celebrated in the month of November in an annual festival in villages across their strongholds, were the most important celebration for the Naxalites. Martyrs’ Day marked the death of people who had sacrificed their lives to create a new moral world, transforming them into immortal celestial bodies leading the path forward, passing on the dreams of an imagined future society, entrusting others to realise them. Martyrdom transformed the emotions provoked by the brutal deaths of comrades in the struggle from being a sentimental weakness into a powerful creative emotional force, fighting the cause of the oppressed, representing the future utopian world, the abstraction of an ideal to lead the revolutionary struggle. Martyrdom enabled the creation of the perfect revolutionary, fighting the cause of the oppressed, representing the future utopian world, the abstraction of an ideal to lead the revolutionary struggle.<br></br>

	Martyrs gave the life-transcending permanence that was necessary to penetrate the present world with ideas of the extraordinary future world the guerrillas wanted to create. The burden of the martyrs contained a legacy; it was the means by which those in the movement sought to constantly improve themselves; it was the essence of what it means to be the perfect human.<br></br>

	On the one hand, Hindu, Buddhist or Jain monks renounce the hierarchies of their society to liberate themselves individually from the endless cycles of rebirth to reach an eventual future world of equality. On the other hand, India’s Naxalite guerrillas break with their pasts to commit to a casteless and classless community, seeking to liberate the whole of society for a more equal future to be fought for in the present. Whereas one seeks emancipation for the individual in the future, the other works for the ideal of liberation for communal ends in the present. But both involve a conviction and commitment, a faith in the means to an end, which, like following a religious doctrine, is hard to shake. They are both willing to sacrifice everything, including themselves, to attain their ideals of liberation. Taking up arms is then merely one of the means to this end. Whether one agrees with these revolutionary methods or not, the hierarchies of Indian society have themselves produced some of the world’s most committed pursuers of a more equal society.

- As is so often the case with war, the poor were now being used to fight the poor. Targeted recruitment of Adivasi boys into the police and the security forces had begun. In neighbouring states like Chhattisgarh, the police had armed Adivasi boys as Special Police Officers and armed Adivasi vigilante groups, recruiting from the very communities the Naxalites lived amidst, pitting the poor against the poor to kill each other. <br></br>
	In the end they would never get rid of the politicians who collaborated with the multinational companies and created government economic policy that generated inequality; instead, the Naxalites would kill the hundreds of young Adivasi soldiers who were being used by the state armies. The young men who fronted the security forces would be the Naxalites’ first casualties. The state repression of the kind being generated against them dangerously reduced their revolutionary activities to military strategy alone. In the face of this despair, it was hard to keep hope alive, making it far too easy to start replicating the violence of the oppressor. This state repression, he continued, gave them little space to work with the people. It did not allow them to develop political consciousness, political education or mass mobilisation. The danger, he said, was that people joined the Maoists without sharing their vision and imagination of a different world. And in that context, the gun became just a means of accelerating their upward social mobility within the very systems the Maoists sought to crush.
