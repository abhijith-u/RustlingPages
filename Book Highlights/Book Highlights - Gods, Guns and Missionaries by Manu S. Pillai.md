#### Introduction
##### Chapter Summary: 
This chapter deals with the circumstances preceding the rise of the system that we now know as Hinduism and the dominating influence that Brahmins have wielded in sculpting it into the form that we know today. The shaping of power structures by legitimising the so-called "divine right" of the ruling class and by carefully integrating the existing dominant narrative with Brahmanical ideas, leading to either the downgrading of opposing philosophies such as Buddhism and Jainism and simultaneously the assimilation of folk practices and legitimising them with Puranic references, was the highlight of the Brahmanical influence on shaping present-day Hinduism and its practices.
##### Highlights:
- One of the brightest gifts of the Indian priest is the ability to bypass awkward corners between theory and reality through the manipulation of tradition. For centuries, kings were consumers of this marvelous Brahmin talent. Nearly each time a peasant chief or warrior achieved a degree of power, for instance, it was the Brahmin he turned to, seeking legitimization through an upgrade in caste and ritual status. For the Brahmin ritualist, this reaffirmed his unique right to bestow status; for the would-be king, meanwhile, it was elevation from an ordinary provenance into a league of semi-divine proportions.
- Hinduism, as it would emerge, was not so much what Brahmins wanted; instead, it is the story of their negotiations with a bewildering variety of counter-thoughts and alternate visions. Change is coded into its DNA. 
- As monarchies emerged in India, Brahminical ideas on social stratification, the portal various rites opened to the gods and its means to supply legitimacy established a reciprocal (if also tense) bond between power and religion. This dialectic of mutual construction—Brahmins conferring the status of Ksatriyahood on kings and the Ksatriyas making Brahmins powerful by their patronage—is predominantly the story of Brahmin ideology in premodern India. Contenders appeared in the form of Buddhism and Jainism, growing popular with those segments excluded from the accord between Brahmins and royalty.
- The advent of Greeks, Indo-Scythians and other foreign tribes in the north-west meant that unforeseen political and cultural ideas were also entering the fray from a different direction, adding to the competitiveness of the religious market. In the circumstances, Brahmins had again to adapt. Already in the Atharva Veda—the youngest of the four—we find Vedic deities sharing spaces with ‘folk’ gods. as their Indo–Aryan ancestors abandoned nomadic ways for settled agrarian life in the Gangetic belt, their religion had changed: Its emphasis slid from the ritual act to philosophical reflections collected in the later Vedic corpus, the Upanishads—which, in turn, may have been catalysed by exchanges with other indigenous groups. All ideas were welcome, but those closest to the Brahmins’ own were deemed higher or superior, and those more grating, lower.
- Old gods of the Vedic age, such as Indra and Agni, made way for two powerful deities, Vishnu and Siva, with their own mythologies and strategies to counter Sramanic ambitions. Non-Vedic gods could be merged with Vedic counterparts, and Brahmins accepted popular elements from the other side, while cladding it in their theological principles. The Mahabharata, for instance, sells the (Brahmin-approved) concept of monarchy over other systems,  but the polyandrous marriage of its five heroes to a single wife suggests un-Aryan influences too. Indeed, the other marriages of the Pandavas with the so-called demons (like Hidimbi), Nagas (like Ulupi) and Yadavas (like Subhadra) also indicate non-Aryan alliances.
- Into the first millennium CE , then, what we frame within the blanket term ‘Hinduism’ had shed most of its Vedic appearance, becoming a more mixed commodity known as the Puranic religion. As ever larger tribes and societies were drawn in, more and more redactions appeared, including sub-Puranas for distinct regions and castes. The Puranas are works of genius. They acquired their fluid form not to meet present-day scholarly standards but to tie the local with the pan-Indian, and the evolving with the stable. Even if tenuously, they established links, unified disparate elements, all while giving the Brahmin vision of society immortality by owning traditions that otherwise might rise in opposition.
- ‘Brahmanism having failed to conquer’, was itself ‘conquered by the multitudes’.  It was entirely natural, then, that the resultant product—Hinduism—became a ‘macro-reality of organically united micro-realities’. Brahminhood itself became a contested, jumbled category—this was not one caste, but many. There was only one varna, that is, of Brahmins. But within this varna—or caste category—many jati s, sub-castes, existed. The same is true of non-Brahmin groups also, and often politically ascendant jatis might claim a higher varna status. So long as the Vedas were not denied and the caste superiority of Brahmins were accepted, practically anybody—holding a variety of ideas—could be brought into the frame. That way Vedic texts remained formally supreme even if it was a later, more mixed corpus that better represented religious reality—a situation we might describe as a ‘win-win’.
- It is this many-faced, multi-layered system that we today call Hinduism. While Hindus had many ways and practices, then, it was arguably Brahmins who helped sculpt Hinduism . And most importantly, this endowed this class with control over the pan-Indian narrative—a source of immense power, which would in time catalyse Hindu nationalism.
- Commitment to a personified god, as opposed to the abstract entity, was the result of bhakti, or devotionalism. It was among Tamils, in the Tamil language, that Bhakti emerged. Worship was no longer about fire sacrifices to invisible deities, or a philosophical acceptance of the almighty; the emphasis moved to the individual beholding divinity. Gods were humanized: They could be cajoled, flattered, reprimanded, loved, spurned, threatened but always embraced by emotion. Soon, royalty became sponsors of temples: Valuable real estate was bestowed, and rulers, advertising their power, assumed protectors’ duties. In time, the temple evolved roles as banker, cultural timekeeper, economic engine and a supplier of stability when political sands shifted. And as Brahmins adapted to endorse and co-opt these novel forms of worship—which many first scorned—bhakti received theological certification as a legitimate route to liberation. early shoots of sectarian identities—as defined now, where people perceive themselves as followers of a specific faith—started making their appearance. The control of land meant that shrines developed patronage networks, supporting musicians, priests, dancers, farmers, artisans and, over time, whole communities, all while injecting into these specific social ideologies.
- Puranic stories welded together diverse physical temple sites. Pilgrimage becoming a popular means to experience divinity; a path that did not involve asceticism or monkhood. It also generated a culture of commonality despite different vocabularies, tongues and histories. Viewed this way, latter-day India’s slogan of ‘Unity in Diversity’ acquires a different origin.
- Feuds were not uncommon between partisans of Siva and Vishnu (Saivas and Vaishnavas), and of both against Jains and Buddhists. Even in the oldest Tamil poetry, thus, the bigger enemy is the Jain or Buddhist. From major shrines to obscure ones, it was possible to reclaim and reinvent them according to shifting patterns—something that direly affected the Sramanic religions once they lost out to Puranic rivals. Even proponents of bhakti, while democratizing devotionalism and access to god, hesitated to challenge caste in secular settings. What is remarkable is that Brahmins nearly everywhere won towering social positions.
- Then, India’s religious and cultural landscape was disrupted by another new force: the creed of Muhammad. Indeed, just as Brahmins claimed they were settled in these parts by a Vishnu avatar, the story of the convert rajah opened narrative windows for Islam also to smoothly slide into local imagination. As Muslims familiarized themselves with the land, in other words, they too deployed stories comparable to those in the Puranas. Islam’s advent in the _north_, however, was not via networks of maritime commerce but through battlefields. Unlike in Kerala, then, where mythmaking eased Islam’s entry, in the north, it would come to be perceived by some as a devourer of Hindus, and a civilizational adversary.
- Brahmin intellectuals struggled, not least because it was tough to draw the Muslim neatly into the Puranic universe. For already evolved and packaged in the Perso–Arabic world, this religion was unlikely to succumb to the typical overtures. Some of it was about principles—if Brahmins ordered the world into castes, Islam, at least in theory, proposed egalitarianism. And while there was no single pan-Indian Hinduism, Brahmins had, as we saw, formed a ‘consciousness’ of unity, to which Muslim power posed a threat. It was, as Tagore would put it in _Nationalism_, however, a ‘feeble’ unity, always faced with the pressure of managing diversity. India was to reconcile to the existence [and possibility] of a _separate_ culture-community’—something that, given the abruptness with which it happened, triggered mixed feelings, its worst coming to a head with the subcontinent’s partition in the 1940s.
- By the thirteenth century, a Muslim dynasty was entrenched in Delhi, and its armies would overwhelm most of the subcontinent. Under a topsoil of Islamic rule, subordinate Hindu dynasties survived all the way from the medieval period till the mid-twentieth century. Yet, the threat was ever-present: 400 years later, thus, the formidable Tipu Sultan in his home provinces was a patron of shrines, honouring Hindu spiritual heads and having temple rites performed in his name. But when he invaded Kerala next door, without irony the same man deployed violent rhetoric, shattered idols and proved a terror. The reverse too occurred—Chhatrapati Shivaji, founder of the Maratha state, in his seventeenth-century kingly narrative is Vishnu manifested to destroy ‘unruly Muslims’. This while his father, Shahaji Bhonsle, was apparently named after a local Muslim divine, Shah Sharif of Ahmednagar. Shivaji also employed many muslims in his army. Indeed, while contradictions were stressed during conflict, in everyday terms, constructive exchange was inevitable.
- Islam, then, was different but not ‘inexpressibly alien’, not least because Muslims in India were themselves diverse and the opposite of a monolith. Yet, the religious divide was not artificial or a colonial invention, as is sometimes argued by the well-intentioned, who seek to bridge current religious cleavages in India. For at an intellectual level, notions of ‘Us and Them’ always persisted between Muslims and Hindu elites. Even under the kindest sultans, temple worship was tolerated, not endorsed; Brahmins were respected, but no Muslim power was likely to admit their pretensions to superiority.
- Two ideas appeared of the Indian nation: a pluralistic one with room for all, celebrating syncretic aspects of the Hindu–Muslim encounter. And another, equating India with a Hindu nation, galvanized by memories of persecution by Muslim kings and, as we shall see, Christian colonialists.
- Masked under that disarmingly plain term ‘Hinduism’ is a many-layered phenomenon—from a leaner Vedic personality, it became something richer in the Puranic age; exchanges with tribal cults, Buddhism, Jainism and Islam activated fascinating transformations. Things were perplexing enough by the early modern era, until the arrival of European powers—and, in their wake, politically backed Christianity—slapped on a fresh coat of complexity.
- Certainly, ‘Hinduism’ as a term is of recent vintage. And yet, once created, Hindus seized that expression, recognizing something familiar there. To suggest this was passive acquiescence in a foreign-made identity is simplistic. The encounter with Islam had initiated a feeling of oneness among Hindu thinkers, building on an older unifying Brahminical impulse. Confronted by colonialism, such instincts grew firmer. While the name is modern, the river is old. Historically, Hinduism did not fit the mould of book-based religions, though in its modern form, it does appropriate many of the latter’s features.


#### Monsters And Missionaries
##### Chapter Summary: 

This chapter tries to understand the initial arrival of Christian missionaries to India and how they tried to wrap their heads around the complexities of Hindu society. Europeans, familiar with a structured template, try to box Hindus and their religion into a similar template, but having failed to do so, resort to constructed clichés and fear-mongering in an attempt to make themselves feel better while ensuring the exaggerated reports help them get the necessary funding from their patrons back at home. The Portuguese arrival and their subsequent attempts at conversion through force fail spectacularly, and the newer Jesuits then, realising that there is more to Hinduism than the 'savage' stories that they have been fed with, try to make Christianity more palatable to Indians by importing several Hindu practices, such as caste and scriptures, into a Christian style, and thereby succeed in getting a number of converts, notably through the efforts of Jesuits like Robert De Nobili, the 'Italian Brahmin.'

This period might also be considered as one that gave the initial impetus to 'Hindu nationalism,' where the Hindus see how the foreigner looks and tries to understand Hindu practices and customs, and, unable to understand the context behind them, labels these as 'barbaric' and tries to introduce his brand of 'civilisation.'. The coercion and aggressive methods employed to do this probably made the locals look at themselves as being 'suppressed' and tried to compensate for this by countering with their own aggressive pushbacks.

##### Highlights:
For few Europeans had direct experience of the topics they described, with the result that unchristian subjects were pressed into ready-made, more familiar Christian templates. As multi-armed, many-headed Hindu deities were heard of, these too were retrofitted into available medieval categories. Or as Mitter tells, ‘classical monsters and [pagan] gods, Biblical demons and Indian gods were all lumped together’ in one universal master class: that of ‘monsters’. Received (un)wisdom of this variety was to go a long way in framing India and its culture in the West now. Sati, limited to certain classes and places,  was identified as a defining feature of Hinduism. Additionally, given that such travelogues were sparse in number, each possessed the capital to launch stereotypes. Overzealousness—became the latest staple in travel diaries, its horror inspiring a heap of supposed eyewitness accounts. From the end of the medieval times, down to the colonial age, then, there was an information network that duplicated certain clichés about India and Hindus, helping Europeans construct a self-image of themselves as better.

---
As for the Hindus, at first India’s residents could not have cared for what itinerant Europeans were writing about them, their gods and culture. But as the white man’s political power grew in the country, his skewed narratives—and the prejudice these came to represent—acquired the ability to afflict their world. And so, these would slowly become a threat, till in time Hindus themselves were forced to answer the question: Who were they, really? If not devil-worshippers, what was their religion truly about? In a world where other (unfriendly) cultures could scrutinize their identity, how might they articulate their self-image? It was in the construction of these answers that Hinduism took its contemporary, modern form, drawing pride and confidence from certain aspects of its past and shame from others.

---
The story of Hindus’ life under Western authority begins in 1498. In May that year, Portuguese sailors landed in Kerala on the Indian coast. Portugal’s elite and royalty were propelling the venture: Unlike traders, incentivized to keep their heads down, minimize risks and turn profits, these aristocratic backers hoped to acquire that extra commodity called glory. They had ‘the gun in [their] hand and’, they were certain, ‘god on [their] side’, all this stemming from a religious fervour inflecting politics in their own part of the world. 

---

It helped that inland powers in India took little interest in maritime affairs, allowing the Portuguese to militarize international waters. Armed aggression in disrupting pre-existing networks also turned them into predatory extortionists. With the establishment of a white ruling class in their tracts, the Portuguese came into everyday contact with Hindus, armed with scarce knowledge but copious pre-judgement. With the emerging Protestant movement accusing the Catholic church of perverting the faith, Catholic powers had a special necessity to demonstrate unequivocal Christian credentials. And here, their newly acquired Indian enclaves offered a parade ground, packed as they were with devil-worshipping pagans.

---
local Hindu elites had aided the Europeans in taking Goa from its previous (Muslim) masters.  They would regret this, though, for no sooner were their new rulers secure than they proved worse than the last regime. In 1540–41, hundreds of temples were razed, their assets appropriated for Christian institutions. 

---
Hindu princes tended to wrest deities; non-Hindu powers threatened their destruction. So, new strategies were invented: Some gods were hidden behind walls, others in ponds; occasionally decoy gods were planted to mislead. Why, certain Hindu deities were secreted away disguised as corpses. Something similar transpired in Goa now, as gods looked for sanctuaries from white tyranny. Temples, after all, were being ‘demolished stone by stone’, the deities within ‘burnt’, ‘beaten into pulp’ or, if they were metal, melted for reuse as church objects and chandeliers. The Portuguese had to demonstrate with fire and blood that they were authentic Christians. 132 And Hindus suffered in the process.

---
Kerala was home to the Nasranis, who claimed descent from converts left by the apostle St Thomas in 52 CE. They performed similar rituals as Hindus, had notions of caste purity, and maintained links with temples—a syncretism which to Europeans was scandal. At first, they sought to shepherd Nasranis into the Catholic fold through persuasion. In 1599, after their Persian bishop died, the community was coerced into accepting Catholic suzerainty. It divided Kerala’s Christians but enough in the community clung to the old ways: The cock sacrifices continued, as did traditions in which figures like St George are cast as siblings to fiery goddesses like Kali.

---
In all this, the nascent beginnings of something powerful is visible. Among Hindus, persecution by an alien race wielding a foreign faith would, at one level, spark a soul-searching of sorts. It was clear to most in Goa that what the Portuguese were doing was not merely politics; religion was enmeshed in it. not all Hindus were prepared to submit to this ‘catechism through fear’.  Herein lies the impulse that would mark political Hinduism. 

---
Life in Goa was tough, with employment, political status and much else made contingent on Christianization. There were creative strategies also to bypass the imbalance in power. Parking gods just miles outside Goa’s limits, for instance, Hindus wooed converts, encouraging apostasy. Brahmins manufactured rites to re -convert lapsed Hindus: You could bathe in the sea or wash yourself with Ganga water. Shrines outside Goa where exiled deities now resided were often grander than their original seats, in visual defiance of the Portuguese. In the end, the government relaxed its grip, not least because its policies had proved bad for business. Many deities returned to Goa, and Catholics and Hindus began sharing festivals, Christian saints receiving veneration from the latter, 169 and Hindu goddesses winning Catholic devotees.

---
Local culture, it would seem, ultimately triumphed over decrees of the foreigner. But for future Hindu nationalists this was exactly it—Hindus, they would argue, were naively large-hearted. Alien faiths, on the other hand, with the slightest power in so small a quarter as Goa, tended towards aggression. Hindus, it would be lamented, were habitually prepared to forgive the worst horrors; tolerance on their rivals’ part, however, was based only on practical calculations. Old patterns, therefore, would no longer do. To prevent old horrors from recurring, they could neither forgive nor forget. And memories of persecution—and resistance—would one day supply the raw material for articulating a unified, combative Hinduism; one aspiring not only to defend itself but of actively going on the offensive.

---
In Tamil country, there were thirty villages of Paravar converted around the 1530s, but this was not because Jesus appealed to this low-ranking group of fishermen, and boat- and salt-makers. Facing competition from rivals in the pearl-fishing sector, the Paravar had sought Portuguese security and were claimed wholesale in a quid pro quo—a commercial rather than spiritual transaction.

---
For missionaries, this more sophisticated glimpse of Hindu ideas generated a problem, for they could no longer simply traffic in stereotypes. They would, instead, have to apply themselves to gathering real knowledge before they could debunk the Hindu system. This was not simple polytheism—if there was a variety of gods in shrines, these were all ‘under’ a formless great being.

---
Thomas Stephens, composed the *Kristapurana* (‘Christ Purana’) in a blend of the Marathi and Konkani languages. Instead of inflicting Latin alone and patronizing lectures, the man crafted a vehicle for Christian ideas, imitating Hindu devotional poetry. Where Europeans so far clumsily pushed Eastern concepts into Western moulds—and damned them for not fitting—they now attempted the reverse, veiling imported spiritual cargo in ‘native’ fabric.

---
Catholics were linked too closely with the Portuguese, who, to Hindu elites, lacked dignity. The Parangi (a corruption of ‘Frank’, for Europeans) was pegged with drinking, rowdiness (thanks to sailors), inferior castes (like the fishermen Xavier converted). And it was true that, outside Goa, most converts were of lower caste; a reason why even the Nasranis hesitated to adopt Catholicism.

---
Robert de Nobili, an Italian Jesuit, turned his gaze to the cream of Hindu society. For if they were wooed, prestige would encase Christianity. It was critical, that is, to aim high and pluck from the top. He embraced their sartorial tastes, dressing hereon like a sanyasi in saffron robes. He even restyled the Christian message—he spoke not of the Parangi Margam but *Satya Vedam* (‘true religion’), with himself as *tattvabodhakar* (‘teacher of truth’). By 1610, his Jesuit bosses in Goa learnt that he had acquired a sacred thread, worn by Brahmins across the torso, and that he no longer ate meat. So much so that many believed he was preaching a new religion. De Nobili even invented new rites: When a Brahmin came on, he cut his old sacred thread, and gave him a ‘Christian’ one with a cross. Like Hindus, Madurai’s new Catholics continued to apply sandalwood paste to the foreheads, and before mass, the father performed puja, or worship as in temples. After all, he wrote, ‘I professed to be an Italian Brahmin’.

---
At a time when the church had closed ranks to battle the Reformation in Europe, de Nobili was skating alarmingly close to inventing a brand-new headache. In 1612, they asked him not to separate his high-caste Christians from those ‘reeking with the stench of fish’ serviced by his partner; that all Christians must pray together was not negotiable. The Italian obeyed the letter of the command but violated its spirit by seating converts in separate rows by caste. By the time of his death in 1656, the Madurai mission commanded the loyalty of thousands. There were, unfortunately, not many Brahmins, but other high-born groups were attracted. To his naysayers, then, the Italian Brahmin’s success was its own answer. Inculturation grew so strong that when in 1744 Rome withdrew support, it was simply too late—Tamil Catholics were not amenable to European micromanagement. Their faith, while theologically distinct from that of Hindus, shared a ‘common religious idiom’—it had ensconced itself into a Hindu terrain.

---
Essentially, then, Christianity was altered. The Portuguese attacked Nasranis for appearing too Hindu; ironically now, their Catholic faith was succumbing to the same influences. Its greatest proof was the centrality of caste to ‘native’ Christians. Hinduism did not absorb Christianity as it once had tribal cults. Meanwhile, the latter, for its part, while staying separate, maintained a ‘native’ appearance, not posing as pointed a threat as the church in Goa. Christian saints simply joined a general cast of gods and goddesses in these parts.

---
For future Hindu nationalists , though, there was cause for worry, nevertheless. On the one hand, it was clear that political power made all the difference. Goa’s Christianization and demographic transformation, after all, was a result of Portuguese control of the state. The lesson, then, was that Hindus must always retain a grip over authority. But the Madurai (Tamil Catholic) formula was no better. The irony, of course, is that this strategy—of much acceptance with some rejection—was how Brahmins too planted their ideas across the subcontinent over the centuries, synthesizing countless groups and tribes into the Hindu order. Viewed this way, de Nobili was following an Indian tradition; the white Brahmin was, inadvertently, enacting the brown one’s playbook.

#### ‘HEATHENS’ AND HIDDEN TRUTHS
##### Chapter Summary: 
Continuing from the previous chapter, this chapter into the how the West tries to rebrand the Hindu religion into a more relatable, approachable religion, mainly for the Western audience. After their failed attempts at forceful conversion, the Europeans realise that there is more to this 'native' religion than meets the eye, and go about trying to understand it through its sciptures.

This starts with the effort to identify 'true' Hindusim, and that effort culminates in the initiation of the Vedas as the 'core' of Hinduism. The fact that the Vedas were purely scriptural bases, and most of the actual practice was based on Puranic interpretations of the Vedas was lost on them. In their 'quest' to uncover 'hidden' Hinduism, the Europeans inadvertently ended up giving the Vedas, and thereby the Brahmins, extraordinary authority in the Hindu religion. Equating a single source, the Bible, as the universal tenet of the religion worked for Christianity, and they tried to accord the Vedas the same status to simplify their understanding of Hinduism.

The natives, however, didn't seek to 'identify' their religious practices in such terms. They mostly reconciled with their beliefs, and with each other, helped by their own understanding of the complex and intertwined philosophies in Hinduism. Even the Brahmins had to resort to various Puranas and other scriptures which merged local customs with their philosophies to compensate and nulify practical difficulties. But the European mind, unable to comprehend this diversity, tried to box Hinduism into their understanding of what a 'religion' should be, and their understandings and translations invariably ended up confusing not just them, but the natives as well, who had now found the need to balance their beliefs with that of the White man's impression of their religion.


##### Highlights 
Jesuits Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg and his colleague, Heinrich Plütschau, sensing that they were ‘more likely to achieve success with children whose minds were still impressionable’, began spending their meagre resources on a new school, borrowing when they needed more food and coin.  It was an early personification of the idea of mission education in India: something that would proliferate and leave a greater impact in the Hindu world than preaching itself.

---
Just as different castes and tribes in India chose from a panoply of sects, deities and styles of worship—ranging from ascetic renunciation to boisterous, ecstatic bhakti—Christians were welcome to do what they pleased. But they were expected to operate within a competitive spiritual marketplace, not attempt to capture or overturn it.

---
To Christians, theirs was the only bona fide Religion; everything else was diabolical pretension or primitive paganism. That the world might house religions (plural) of varying formats—and, significantly, that Christianity was not unique—was tough to swallow even at a conceptual level. Ziegenbalg’s thesis had a subtle suggestion—that Christians had no new message to deliver, and that Hindus had within their traditions, strands aligned with the best of Biblical teachings—was a dangerous line. The church was looking neither for nuance nor a research paper on pagan theology. And so, when his thesis arrived in the post, it was denied publication.

Missionaries, Ziegenbalg learnt, had better stick to prescribed goals, armoured in dogma; to allow pagan ideas to spark self-doubt was unwise. And if knowledge of local thinking were acquired, this must be deployed only to ridicule their source, not reflect on Christianity and its limits.

---
The message foreshadowing the rise of modern Hinduism was this: White men might corner power in India. Where religion and identity were concerned, though, ‘natives’ could—and would—stubbornly continue to refuse instruction.

---
The proposition that Hinduism had higher and lower forms—the first resembling monotheism, the other ‘messily’ polytheistic—was neither new nor a European bifurcation. The gap with monotheisms elsewhere, however, is evident: In the West, principle and practice (largely) coincided. There was one god to whom prayers were addressed. In India, though, the principle sat atop a polytheistic infrastructure: God was one but worship was directed at many deities, drawn from a variety of cults, a few even competing for recognition as **the** god. Where Christians demonized all Hindu deities, some Hindus branded some gods ‘false’ in matching terms. 

Puranic Hinduism, cross-fertilized by so many sources, never had just one response to things. So, despite naysayers, most Brahmins adapted. White men saw in this hypocrisy and trickery, but to Hindus, this was entirely in keeping with their many-storeyed history and plural personalities.

---
It was Brahmins who typically provided narrative coherence for this diversity of thought and action, tailoring answers to the askers’ expectations. Unsurprisingly, they were showcased as the best candidates to explain Hinduism. Indeed, dialogue with Brahmins opened up a less unkind view of Hinduism among some missionaries.

Sectarian intricacies too were identified; Brahmins were not a uniform bloc—there were Vaishnavas (who projected Vishnu as supreme), Saivas (who argued for Siva), Saktas (for whom god was a goddess) and Smartas (who acknowledged all three and more as forms of divinity). 108 Subtler elements were not missed either, such as the ‘ingenious’ Puranic formula of linking temples to the great narrative via stories.

---
Conversion, that is, was positioned not as a choice between falsehood and truth—which failed on Hindus, with their infuriating relativism—but as a road to all milk, zero poison. Just as there were higher and lower paths within Hinduism, Christianity ranked above ‘native’ religion. By the eighteenth century, then, the attitude towards Hindus became a welter of contradictory feelings, ranging from violent opposition to compromise.

The Protestant Reformation, combined with dynamics set off by the Renaissance, had led to a so-called Age of Enlightenment. Just as Protestants employed arguments against idolatry to discredit Catholics, Western rationalists, sceptics and scientists now calculated that Hindu philosophy might smash the orthodoxy in Europe. So, a reading of Hinduism, intended to buttress European preoccupations, gained intellectual currency.

A quest would begin for ‘authentic’ Hinduism, separated from its complicated living culture. The latter was confusing; the former Westerners might understand, and indeed, even exploit for their own purposes. Europe too, that is, was discovering ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ Hinduism. And in isolating the first, and seeking monotheism outside the Christian tradition, it would soon fix its attention on the Brahmins’ most hallowed literature: the Vedas.

---
It is ironic that an eighteenth-century Catholic was so anxious to assault Hinduism by stressing the cleavage between scriptural recommendations and actual practice. For this was exactly how the Roman church was assailed by Protestants from the sixteenth century onwards. One of the most stinging charges against Catholicism by Martin Luther had been that it screened off the Bible—in obscure Latin, with translations into vernaculars barred—from the masses. Ordinary Christians were fobbed off with the worship of saints, colourful processions and a camouflaged idolatry, while god’s message circulated among the clerical few. Besides, for all its pretensions to holiness, even the text preserved by Rome was full of errors; in adjudicating the meaning and texture of every concept, the Catholic church had corrupted god’s word.

As for the Vedas, if they were really god’s message, why hesitate to reveal them? The answer could only be that either the books were rubbish or that Brahmin exceptionalism and control depended on a monopoly—much like the Catholic clergy. Hindus could not filter truth from falsehood due to unfamiliarity with their texts. If at all fragments were revealed, it was to serve Brahmin interests only.

---
In this Age of Enlightenment, reason and rationality were leading virtues. And while there was a flash of atheism, many thinkers retained faith—except their god was no longer tethered to scripture.


---
In a sense, it was the idea of the Vedas that gripped Europe, not its contents. Simply stated, white thinkers in the West, disillusioned with religion at home, felt the need to idealize an alternative; to construct a counter with which to hem in Christianity. Hinduism—once dismissed as a demonic cult—was presented as just the item. Like our Mughal prince, Dara Shukoh (Shahjahan's son) who culled portions of the Vedas to ‘find’ his hidden book, Europeans too were picky. They preferred Hinduism’s hazy antiquity—where they could fill in the blanks as suited them—to its living reality. Indeed, digging through the debris that was the Hindu present to revive its past acquired a certain glamour, and all kinds of theories were professed.

Hindu convictions were hereafter ‘badly translated, or wrongly interpreted’. The result was that the ‘natives’ grew ignorant, with a (Puranic) ‘sequel’ conflated with (Vedic) originals. And viewed this way, the conclusion was obvious: Hindus’ ‘true religion’ resided in a ‘faithful translation of the Vedams’. Everything else was a weak, toxic appendage, and ought to be discarded to retrieve a purer nucleus—a premise that lingers on to this day.

---
Of course, this was historically unsound. Puranic Hinduism emerged not because of invasions but through an interaction between the Brahmins’ religion, as it migrated with them across the subcontinent, with a variety of local systems. It was the Puranas—exactly the material dismissed now for irrationality, its carnal gods and temples—that was truly representative of Hindus at large. The Vedas, on the other hand, had remained the preserve of a small, select set of Brahmins and scholars.

---
Importing European dynamics into India, white men in effect expected ordinary Hindus—of so many castes, with so many histories, no one like the other—to subscribe purely to an orthodox, ancient Brahmin position, when historically this was a more complex engagement. In other words, foreigners would teach Indians ‘authentic’ Hinduism and where to find it. But this also begs the question: How did Hindus themselves perceive the Vedas traditionally?

Different sects competed to assert that they alone had comprehended the Vedas properly. The Vedas are not one. The older portions are called *karma-kanda* , focused on sacrifice, rituals and invocations to ancient deities (most of whom would be overshadowed by Vishnu and Siva). The vedanta —the ‘end’ of the Vedas, both in a literal and metaphorical sense—meanwhile is the *jnana-kanda* , the repository of wisdom, containing the Upanishads. These are the pillars of Hindu philosophy.

---
Religion was not ‘a series of propositions to be believed but a series of practices to be undertaken’. If the Vedas were unknown to most Hindus—including many Brahmins—so too the Bible was ‘alien to the great majority’ of lay Christians. Yet, there was a difference. For while Christianity drew from a core book, Hindus possessed a wider, segmented archive, stitching up countless groups, ideologies, gods and identities in various periods across vast geographies. Each thread in this evolving web had a personality; each could inform and alter others while retaining its distinctness.

Predictably, there were schools that tested this. Some Saiva traditions, for example. One text, the *Sivadharmottara* brands Vedic studies a ‘waste’.  Another subordinates the Vedas; Saiva scriptures emerged from god’s ‘highest’ face, the Vedas only from ‘inferior faces’. In the Narada Sutras , similarly, bhakti triumphs ‘even the Vedas’. Nevertheless, implicit here is recognition of the texts as a gold standard. And in time, most sects, including several ‘propounding anti -Vedic’ ideas, were reconciled via ‘statements of conformity’. Similarly, though the Vedas show little room for image worship, Vedic mantras became an essential component of temple ritual.

---
White writers, though, were oblivious to such nuances. Instead of recognizing the numerous rivulets that together form the Hindu tradition, they assumed that a single fount came first, splintering over time into the seemingly muddy streams and puddles of ‘idolatrous’ Hinduism. In any case, the Hindu attitude vis-à-vis scripture would have scandalized them. For applied to the Western context, this was akin to saying that one could back a range of things—from idols to animal sacrifice—and remain Christian by acknowledging the Bible.

Nevertheless, in Western eyes, ‘pure’ Hinduism gained a definite appearance: The Vedas were its Bible, and a certain kind of orthodox, scholarly Brahmin alone could speak for it. It did not matter that this ‘pure’ Hinduism foreigners idealized never existed; to expect all Hindus to become rigid votaries of the Vedas was to construct something artificial. So much so that when in the nineteenth century, ‘native’ figures themselves attempted to raise up a scripturalist Hinduism, the majority ignored them, sticking to their temples and custom.

---
There were always ultraconservative Brahmins who too dismissed temples and mass Hinduism. To these purists also, the Vedas, and nothing but the Vedas, defined Hinduism. Which is why, late in the nineteenth century, as the Hindu religion was defined in a Protestant mould, a Brahmin writer would openly state that what was meant by (modern) Hinduism was ‘Brahmanism’—this even as he admitted that down the ladder, observance of Brahminical norms was only ‘fractional’.

Indeed, historically, Brahmin writings were often composed in reaction to preexisting tendencies on the ground—scriptural expostulations compensated for practical inadequacies, and served to help narrative catch up with reality. Now however, a set of Sanskrit books was almost mechanically construed as the ‘authentic’ core of a shambolic religious system—and there were at least some Hindu authorities willing to operate on these terms, energized in their own conservatism by conditions of Western creation.

---
Hindus, after all, rarely sought out an ‘original’ faith: Their religion was mixed, complicated and disputed even—but it was what it was; a living, organic, elastic entity. But then, political events began to make a difference: The advent of the white man’s rule gave white men’s ideas the muscle to remake reality. It was in these circumstances that Hinduism’s current avatar emerged—with one foot in tradition, the other in European sensibilities and confusion.

#### GOVERNING THE GENTOOS
##### Chapter Summary: 

In this chapter, we move ahead to the arrival of the East India Company in India. The Company's main motive being profits, upon its arrival, it was quite passive towards the native religious beliefs unlike the Portuguese, even sometimes encouraging the local customs. Their patronage of local religious processions and rituals was intended at ensuring a smooth trading environment for themselves and their shareholders back home. However, as the Company's ambitions expand, and the influence of the Empire tightens, the infamous 'Western saviour' complex starts reappearing within the Company fold.

As the Company transitions from a trader to a ruler, these changes appear to take form with the then Calcutta Governor General Warren Hastings's attempt to create a 'Hindu Law' to govern the natives. With the coloniser's incomplete understanding of the history and the system on the ground, this was a flawed venture right from the start. Practices which were applicable sometimes only to a minor section of the Hindu population and flawed interpretations were repackaged and codified as 'law'. Such repeated misreading and transgressions were instrumental in the rise of Hindu nationalism, where, according to Pillai, 'Hindus would resort to a nationalism defined by the one thing their foreign rulers could never partake of with them: religion.'

This period also saw the rise in importance of the Brahmin collaborator class, who were the primary intermediaries in the British understanding of the Hindu system. Bureaucracies depended on this class, both the foreigners as well as the local Rajahs, and these Brahmin classes, demonstrating their knack for survival, adapted favourably to both these ruling powers. 


##### Highlights 
---
Like the Portuguese before, ever since the English established trading posts in the country, they had been interacting with Hindus. But unlike the Portuguese, caution was their first principle.hite traders grew rich through exports, their Indian supporters pumped the commissions they earned into traditional channels of patronage. Company-sponsored wealth creation, that is, led to a boom in Hindu practice. In fact, the Company arbitrated caste disputes, while its coins featured Hindu gods; over half of marriages recorded at Madras’ in 1700 were between white men and local women.

---
The transformation of the Company into what a critic lambasted as ‘a state in the disguise of a merchant’ was a process that lasted an age. If in 1757, the victory of their troops against the nawab of Bengal netted 1,50,000 sq. miles of territory in eastern India, it would be 1849 before the Sikh empire in the north-west folded. Mysore in the south was crushed in 1799, while the Marathas of the Deccan—the subcontinent’s final major force—were defeated in 1818. As for India’s increasingly titular suzerains, the Mughals, the last of them would in 1858 be exiled on a bullock cart to Burma. The whole thing occurred in fits and spurts. The British state was certainly embroiled in Company affairs, not only by claiming a portion of Bengal’s income but also because as early as 1764, seventy elected parliamentarians were shareholders of the very corporate machine they would soon be asked to regulate.

---
As early as 1772, even an ex-Company employee warned that British-ruled Indian territories would go ‘from bad to worse’, given that its protectors were really profit-miners. Quarrels broke out between the Board of Control (created by parliament to moderate the Company) and the Company’s directors, and between the directors in turn and men on the ground.

Internal turmoil, thus, pervaded the British encounter with India, and inconsistencies defined policy in territories the Company swept up. All the proverbial glory linked with conquest, thus, barely masks the uncertainty and stress saturating the British experience in India.

---
What is interesting for our purposes, though, is that this caution at first also extended to Hindu institutions and cultural centres. While political interest in the region hinged on connecting Bengal to Madras on the map, for winning over the people and stabilizing the conquest, the governor general wrote, to take ‘every possible precaution to preserve the respect due to the pagoda’ and honour the ‘sanctity of the religious edifices’ as well as the ‘prejudices of the Brahmins’. White men became guardians of gods, managing festivals and religious endowments, British troops marching in Hindu processions. Though some did genuinely respect Hindu culture, few were innocent of the imperial mission; that is, regard for ‘native’ sensibilities emerged from considerations of security. An army could dominate, but not sustain conquest; so, the British would have to compensate by filling Hindu dynastic shoes as seamlessly as possible.

---
At this point, there was no single, dominant strand of imperialism, only skittish variants attempting to establish what might keep ‘native’ energies sedated. This tone is critical: The Company, even if it tolerated Hindu customs, rarely understood or endorsed them. And if it came to conflict between British authority and Hindu ideas, it was clear which would prevail. For instance, the Marathas had a king whose power was usurped by the Peshwas long ago.  While a proposal that the Company claim Peshwa-hood for itself was set aside,  a restoration, albeit in a small enclave, was orchestrated for the king.The restored Maratha chhatrapati (king) was told as much: By no means was Company aid to be construed as reviving ‘even in name’ the Maratha imperium, for then ‘the machine we are setting up will be liable to be turned against

---
The restored Maratha chhatrapati (king) was told as much: By no means was Company aid to be construed as reviving ‘even in name’ the Maratha imperium, for then ‘the machine we are setting up will be liable to be turned against us’. In other words, a foreign corporation was walking a tightrope between its imperial agendas and fitting the mould of a Hindu rajah. And if in Bengal an accident of history made the Company rulers, here there was a conscious—and cautious—building of empire, by alert white hands in a land with many shades of brown.

---
The British must speak to the ‘natives’ in their language, not expect them to lap up English ideals. Thomas Munro (1761–1827), therefore, warned white officers from Madras to avoid being ‘fanatics in politics’. An emerging European tendency to ‘suppose that no country can be saved without [Western] institutions’, must be discarded, for the ‘natives’ already had ‘their own to answer every useful object’. Only such a middle path would permit British power to endure. But then again, precisely because the Company had internal dissonances, there was opposition also to such proposals; there was always an equal number of men who rubbished all this prattle about accommodation.In the British failure to ultimately carry this forward—or bungle it up when they tried—lay a leading trigger for anti-colonial mobilization, including among preceptors of what we now call Hindu nationalism.

---
British policies and corruption had fractured the economy. The Company was in debt (Rs 10 million locally). Additionally, the land was drained to tip the British government also, which since 1767 demanded a share of the pickings. As was reported less than a decade after the British takeover, this country, ‘which flourished [even] under the most despotic’ nawabi regime, had been steered to famine by its new, supposedly more civilised white rulers.

---
In Bengal, we first observe the sustained effect of colonialism on Hindu society, and of India on British minds. The Company Raj was a detached reign of paper—a mark also of its nervousness, separating it from the society it governed; it was ‘natives’ who were forced to navigate the new floor plan. It was the ‘diversity of customs and institutions’ that intimidated the Company; and in seeking to rule without unravelling this lay ‘the origin of those troubles and those confusions that have been . . . the bane and ruin of the inhabitants’. So, in the end, a good part of British administration was improvisation: a shuffling about to balance commercial advantages with the moral pressure to govern; a contest between making money and trying to care about a people with whom these merchant–rajahs saw little in common. Worse still, the corporate character of British authority puzzled Bengalis: Power was exercised not by a king or dynasty that might develop an emotional stake in the land but by a ‘numerous body’, with impermanent members seeking transient benefit. Bengal was like a house with no master, only parasitic tenants.

---
Several of these defects surfaced in Warren Hastings’s effort—and those of his successors—to delineate ‘Hindu law’. And so, as a well-meaning alien, he would aim for a ‘renewal of the laws and forms established of old’, which had been ‘corrupted and distorted’—an attitude, Western intellectuals applied to Indian culture in general.

---
To start with, what was ‘Hindu law’? The fact is that there was no unitary article of this name, everything being determined by context: region, caste, community, economic background, etc. What was law for a group or province might not fly in another; what was right for a litigant could be abhorrent for the one after—a natural state in a pluralistic society. The Sastras never represented Hindu society in full, being an ‘ideologically driven’ (Brahminical) ‘blueprint for the proper management of society’. With glorious inconsistency, they offered Brahmin-approved options for various concerns, for most Hindus did not live by lawbooks in a language few could read. In the 1820s, an official surveying fifty-six castes in the Deccan concluded, thus, that they had ‘no written documents or books to which they refer’. ‘Ancient usage’ dominated, and only in cases of ‘extraordinary difficulty’ were sastras introduced.

The British sought ‘order’, while those living in India already possessed a familiar, evolving system; from their perch, they already had ‘order’. Of course one must watch against romanticizing the existing system; it had flaws that will scandalize modern sensibilities. Or as Guha writes, ‘Customary rights might all too often be but ancient abuses.’  The rich settled matters through fines, while the poor suffered full punishment. And yet, to assuage colonial anxieties, Hastings enshrined a strange cross-breed. Texts referred to by a minority of Hindus were repackaged as the ‘law’ of its totality; legal traditions limited to scholarly Brahmins were now deployed as the primary means to read ‘Hindu law’ in toto. Instead of dealing with Hindus in the present, that is, the white man yet again herded them into a synthetic ‘classical’ past.

---
The Peshwas—themselves Brahmins—had a special incentive in promoting orthodox norms, envisioning a ‘rule by, for and of the Brahmins’; their approach cannot be assumed as the norm for most Hindu rulers. In Rajputana, similarly, Marwar state developed a programme blending orthodox Brahmin and Jain ideas, particularly vegetarianism. And here too, the court’s dictates were often ignored by subordinate chiefs and officeholders. Where local rulers had the cultural resources to negotiate this process, the Company, as an alien entity, flailed.

The result was Nathaniel B. Halhed’s *A Code of Gentoo Laws* (1776). Its preparation was convoluted. Halhed knew Persian but was hopeless in Sanskrit. Eleven Brahmin ‘lawyers’ were summoned from ‘every Part of Bengal’, then, to translate into Persian ‘Sentence by Sentence’ content ‘from various Originals’. And what they set off would, within years, mutate into something unwieldy, frustrating even their countrymen.

---
Interestingly, ‘natives’ were able to adjust somewhat at first. For even as British judges unduly emphasized Sanskrit verse over custom, they relied on Brahmin pandits. And pandits—Hindus living among Hindus—even if they ‘tortured’ texts to fit British standards, managed to bridge them with the people’s ways. But then, in a post-Hastings age, British attitudes changed, undermining ‘native’ readings. So, while some judges continued to depend on pandits, many began to interpret and apply ‘Hindu law’ themselves. Except this was more formulaic. If at all Brahmins were consulted, it was by posing abstract questions, without evidence or details of the specific case.

A lack of historical knowledge generated problems: For years, the courts merrily applied ‘Hindu law’ to Sikhs and Jains, because they had not yet worked out that these groups were not exactly Hindu. 200 And over time, the damage spread. Eventually, then, ‘Hindu law’ became less about Hindus, more about white men and their apprehensions. By 1807, it was reported how the ‘native who has a good cause always applies for a panchayat; while he who has a bad one, seeks the decision of a . . . [British] Judge’ because the system was twisted enough to let the wrong party win, the ‘grotesque absurdity’ of applying Brahminical norms to people with little to do with them.

---
Only when the Company’s attitude stiffened—as we will see—with sober voices being replaced by more hard-line, evangelical thinking, did Hindus turn militant in their opposition. Errors the Portuguese made in Goa the British would begin to commit at a more sophisticated, but no less offensive, scale. And with accommodation—plus the desire for it—fraying, Hindus would resort to a nationalism defined by the one thing their foreign rulers could never partake of with them: religion.

---
Ironically, British imperialism in India saw also the rise of a Brahmin collaborator class, serving and aiding the conqueror. In a sense, the Company here followed a pattern set by modernizing Indian states. As kingdoms transitioned from fragmented systems—where rulers shared power with warlords and diffused institutions—into centralized entities, bureaucracies became critical. In Kerala for example, the Travancore rajah crushed his warrior nobility by the mid-eighteenth century, importing Brahmins from Tamil country to run his government.

Persian-speaking Telugu Brahmins, similarly, had served the Carnatic nawab, and in the seventeenth century, the last Golconda sultan was the instrument of two Brahmins, leading an increasingly Brahmin secretariat. As early as the sixteenth century, in fact, a Vijayanagara emperor had advocated this formula: to cultivate mobile Brahmin professionals in ‘all departments’ over hereditary strongmen, who, with their autonomous power bases, tested the centre.

In mid-seventeenth-century Madras, we already find Brahmin officials wielding extraordinary influence. With the conquest or subordination of ‘native’ states, the Company now scaled up this trend. Even in areas which the Company trounced but did not annex, it placed trusted Brahmins in executive posts. The ‘foreigner’ in these contexts was not only the white man but also his Brahmin aide; Company Raj also enabled a Brahmin Raj. The wonder would not last though: In time, Brahmins would become leading promoters of nationalism in India. Either way, just as the Company had divergent voices within, Indian responses too were not uniform at this stage.

---
Among some men at least, then, the British, despite foreign roots and Christian origins, were viewed as new rajahs. For worldly Brahmins too, this was not radical—they could come to terms with white men as they once had the Mughals. Their very presence in Company offices demonstrated a knack for survival. One might argue that as beneficiaries of British rule, these Hindus had reason to air positive views. Besides, as Brahmins they might have been pleased by the attention the new dispensation gave their texts and traditions.

Hindus of political backgrounds—pressed by the Company’s might—struggled, however. ‘Hindu law’, for instance, benefitted the Company in statecraft. Brahminical theory recognized kingship only for Kshatriyas—the second of the four ‘classical’ caste groups. But Indian princes were often descended from the peasantry; Kshatriyahood was negotiated and acquired. Armed with hardboiled textualism though, the British could declare Hindu rulers bogus. So, even if the rajah were backed by his ‘chief people’ and ‘general opinion’, his status was made reliant on book-wielding Brahmins of a different province.As the anthropologist Bernard Cohn observed, the conquest of India was as much a ‘conquest of knowledge’ as it was of land and goods.

---
The legally enshrined colonial bifurcation of Indian society into two master groups now allowed it a more concrete life. That is, where Hindus had various forms of self-conception, sometimes in tension with one another, the government’s approach empowered religion as an overarching, unifying principle. What was a fuzzy, incomplete feeling received hereon a definite impetus. Coupled in future with colonial censuses, Hindus would slowly begin to conceive of themselves in a new manner.

#### AN INDIAN RENAISSANCE
##### Chapter Summary: 
This chapter starts off with an introduction to the Maratha Rajah Serfoji Bhonsle, who ruled Tanjore from 1777 to 1832. The Rajah was a visionary, blending the comparatively progressive and liberal Eurpoean influences into the Indian education system, but still maintaining traditional 'roots', called the 'Tanjore Enlightenment'.

Around this period, white intellectuals, piecing together a few selective parts of India's rich history, were trying to create a romanticized, 'pure' Hindu religion, heavily biased by Bhraminical narratives. These 'Orientalists', although unintentionally, were instrumental in the way Hinduism, and Hindus themselves, started understanding their culture. It was a Westernised, Catholicized view of Hinduism, completely ignoring the complex and beautiful tapestry threaded over centuries.
##### Highlights 
---
In the summer of 1826, the bishop of Calcutta arrived at the court of the rajah of Tanjore in southern India, and was pleasantly surprised. To begin with, there was a mission at work here with a thriving community of Christians: 1300 Tamils attended a service where he was present. Rajah Serfoji Bhonsle II of Tanjore (1777–1832), the local Maratha rajah, was a seemingly virile mind, embracing the technological and material promise of the West, matching also many cultural benchmarks. Leaving aside the cliché of Eastern depravity, which came so naturally to even the kindest European voices, it was clear that on his Western visitors, Serfoji made a most uncommon impression.

---

Tanjore was once the seat of the medieval Chola emperors, and then the Nayaka dynasty linked to Vijayanagara. Serfoji’s Maratha ancestors came here as agents of an enemy sultan to assist the last of the Nayakas in a contest, only to quickly seize the kingdom for themselves. The Tanjore Marathas styled themselves Choladesadhipathi, Cholabhupathi and Cholasimhasanadhipathi (Lords of Chola country) and after a pilgrimage in 1801, Serfoji consecrated in the great temple 108 lingams brought from different parts of the region. With the little authority left in him as master of a single fort-city, and the monetary resources the British allotted him, the rajah also inaugurated what has been called the ‘Tanjore Renaissance’ and the ‘Tanjore Enlightenment’. It was, to quote a scholar, ‘a knowledge-making process that combined indigenous wisdom with all that was relevant and useful’ in Western culture; it produced modern knowledge that yet remained ‘rooted in tradition’.

---
Serfoji founded institutions for Vedic studies, meeting Brahmin ideals of kingly conduct. But on the other, he also established twenty-one schools offering free education of the European kind, albeit ‘disengaged from Christian frames of reference’ and gave students instruction in five languages: Tamil (of the masses), Marathi (of his court), Telugu (a prestigious language from Vijayanagara’s heyday), Persian (favourite of the Mughal order), and, of course, English (from India’s new overlords). Caste rules were relaxed; orphans and disabled children were admitted; and food and board provided to all in need of. Of course, as always, however, ‘untouchables’ were not permitted. Products of the Tanjore system would in time spread across southern India, achieving distinction.

---
Only an Indian well versed in European and ‘native’ ideas both could pull off something like this; only a Serfoji could Indianize the white man’s knowledge and smoothly blend it with local culture. The Sarasvati Mahal library, built originally under the Nayakas, was expanded, its shelves now featuring 4500 books in Western languages, and ten times as many Indian manuscripts. European music occupied thirty volumes, with local performers trained to play both the Indian veena and the piano. 

To Serfoji, though, this was no paradox: Embracing knowledge, no matter its provenance, sat comfortably with ‘native’ ideals. To admire European advancements did not equal a wholesale purchase of European culture. He could operate both medieval shrines and study cadavers, just as he might use age-old poetic techniques to communicate fresh lessons. The British thought Hindus no good, believing their glories to have faded with the ancient past; and yet here was an exhibit who, even if at a modest scale, achieved greatness in the present. But sadly, little was carried forward: After the rajah died in 1832, the ‘Tanjore Renaissance’ wilted, with only paler versions following in other courts, like in Travancore, for example.

---
Around the same time that Serfoji grew besotted with modern science, white officials launched a romance of sorts with ancient India and its mysteries. For the British, showing an interest in local culture ‘lessen[ed] the weight of the chain by which the natives are held in subjection’. The chain itself was non-negotiable, but with the right sounds, Indians could be lulled into ignoring it. In India, these were often officials moonlighting as savants, with a stated desire for unearthing and disseminating knowledge about the East in the West — their appetite to ‘know’ the country stemmed more from wanting to better rule it.

This new crop of white explorers began to stitch together diffused information, slowly developing a shared, scientifically analysed and systematically presented Indian history—a commodity that would prove useful for nationalists in future. It was through British inquiries that Ashoka was recentered not just as one of India’s most distinguished rulers, but as a global luminary, his influence as a patron of Buddhism felt as far as China.

---

With religion too, there were advances. In the post-Enlightenment age, Puranic material was about as reliable in knowing the world as Greek mythology. But worse was the fact that if pandits taught outdated lessons, it was because the British subsidized this. As early as the 1790s, a Company director thought it ‘folly’ to give brown men’s intellects a modern polish, for armed with fresh ideas around liberty, they might conspire against the British. That is, brown men only needed reminding of the best of their traditional ideas, not a potentially explosive cargo of imported intellectual goods.

Through the first half of the nineteenth century, then, the British oscillated between promoting ‘traditional’ learning and introducing Western ideas, struggling, unlike a Serfoji, to marry the two.  If on the British side, powerful interests wished to use Sanskrit, impart Western ideas to elites through this medium and leave them to filter down, influential ‘natives’ wanted direct access to English.

While there was some romanticization of English here, the fact is that many ‘natives’ equated mastery over it to progress. Under colonial rule, this was to a degree natural; and Hindus had some experience seizing on new languages anyway, as with Persian under Islamic rule.

---
 Instead of being fed ‘what was known two thousand years ago’, **Raja Ram Mohun Roy** sought ‘mathematics, natural philosophy, chemistry, anatomy’ and other ‘useful sciences’. These were the subjects that had elevated the ‘nations of Europe’—this is what ‘natives’ must now have.

The orientalists dismissed this as stemming from purely pecuniary motivations. Indians picked up English but without imbibing seriously Western ideas. Their love of the ruling class’s language was precipitated merely by hopes of employment. And yet, this was an incomplete picture: As the scholar Parimala Rao shows, most jobs available to Indians did not require English and the higher vacancies that did were barred. The jibe that English education produced an army of clerks was incorrect; it would generate ‘political leaders, professional men, and intellectuals’—not unlike Serfoji. And most significantly, many did wish to regenerate their country; and this was addressed directly to the colonial power, in its own mother tongue. Indeed, if in Calcutta the Company set up a Sanskrit college, the city’s first English college was born of a union of brown intellectuals, businesspersons and dissenting white men. Popular demand was its own answer.

---
Macaulay lambasted orientalist peddling of antiquated Sanskrit as sheer irresponsibility. He believed the British must offer fresh ideas, or nava vidya, as Serfoji would have preferred. And for this they needed ‘native’ intermediaries, which, in a sense, was precisely what the Tanjore rajah had also been. Incidentally, such a class was on the rise—English-speaking ‘natives’, transmitting new-found knowledge via local languages. Admittedly, these figures were few and scattered (and had their own class and caste biases), but they nonetheless shared a goal: to ‘transfer,’ as the iconic Bengali educator Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar (1820–91) preferred, ‘the philosophy of the West into a native dress’. 

---

Even as Europe’s technical achievements were conceded, admiration was selective. Accepting the value of Western learning was not tantamount to legitimizing colonial rule. Besides, the whole point of embracing foreign ideas was to revitalize ‘native’ society—and a revitalized society would, it was a given, no longer require foreign superintendence.

With the government reluctant for decades to back elementary education, especially in the vernaculars, missionaries had slid into that space. Of course, the education they supplied was interlaced with religious propaganda, schools being perceived as ‘evangelistic agencies’. But missionaries often found that children would memorize lessons, to pass exams. But hopes that they would understand them were disappointed. As a scholar suggests, ‘the [mere] memorizing of texts’ was perhaps ‘an instinctive defence against a body and form of knowledge that looked hostile to everything that was meaningful in the child’s environment’. 

*****

Hindus were using new-found skills to actually ‘defend their religion’. Indeed, one critic complained, Hindus mastering ‘European languages, writings, and arts and sciences’ showed a distinct tendency to ‘father them on some of their own ancient sages’. *Vigyan*, or science, was a different commodity. The two occupied separate compartments, and one could continue to value the Puranas as religious tradition, while accepting contradictory scientific information in other respects. Ultimately, whether it was with education or Orientalism, the ways in which Hindus responded did not meet their original promoters’ assumptions.

*****

The Renaissance in Europe was catalysed by a renewed interest in ancient Latin and Greek works, not only of a philosophical nature—which generated fresh ways of thinking—but also pertaining to mathematics and science. As Macaulay wrote in his minute, if the British in this time had remained wedded to their Anglo–Saxon literature alone, ignoring a superior store of knowledge that came from these foreign high languages, they could not have progressed. India now, with English, was in the same position.

#### FOR GOD AND COUNTRY
##### Chapter Summary: 
The chapter focusses on the change in the religious attitudes of the British colonisers, where the religious and societal changes in Europe influence their attitude towards the Hindus in India. As the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution progresses, the rapidly urbanizing British society increasingly adopts Evangelical Christianity, where the Church is no longer the "absolute authority". The missionaries and Company's officers from this period are, consequently, less tolerant of the local Hindu practices, and coupled with the Western self-image of being "natural leaders", the attempt to Christianize Indian society gets a fresh boost. The colonisers policy changed from tolerance to assertion, as far as religion was concerned.

Faced with this harrasment, Hindusim reacts by trying to take a 'Catholicized' form o counter the missionary narrative. We see public debates crop up between missionaries and Hindus, the latter using the new-found knowledge from the missionary teachings to their own advantage. English-educated Indians were using the missionaries own religious texts to counter their arguments. 

Based on these facts, an interesting view of the 1857 mutiny is offered. The mutiny, which was earlier considered merely as a reaction to the infringement on religious beliefs, when looked at through the entire colonial history of religious persecution, was not a one-off incident, but the final straw which provided the impetus for the Indians to recover their religious (and obviously political) freedom from the colonisers' grasp.

##### Highlights 

The desire for Christianizing India, expressed from the highest levels, stood at an alarming distance from the caution advocated by Elphinstone, Munro and Malcolm earlier in the century. In their time, when British power looked less certain, ‘native prejudices’ were handled with care. Dalhousie, in the 1850s, however, was restless, brusque even. The governor general conceived of the British empire as a means to disseminate the holy word also. By so doing the Company would serve a taller purpose; Empire was no longer about men doing politics. It became a holy mission entrusted to the British, and it was the Company’s duty to spread the Christian message—even if whole kingdoms fell in the course of this august pursuit.

---
Official attitudes towards Christianizing India featured much ambivalence and hesitation. Company men—fixated on profits—were not enthusiastic about complicating commerce with religion. The SPCK—Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge—lobbied London and presented proselytism as offering political bonuses also. It was claimed that turning ‘natives’ into Christians would cement British power; rulers and the ruled would become one. This was also linked to shifts in public sentiment, including a reaction to the Enlightenment and its elevation of reason over faith.

Into the early nineteenth century, claims began to appear that there was something providential to the British subjugation of India. Coinciding with the Industrial Revolution and material and technological developments in Europe, important minds bought into this self-image of the West as natural leaders, showering gifts of liberty and progress upon darker parts of the world.

---
Among the earliest figures to urge diffusing Christianity in the subcontinent was Charles Grant (1746–1823). Over the next two decades, he would, in coordination with allies, wage a propaganda battle in Britain to push the missionary cause. Even as orientalists sang of the glories of ancient India, its philosophies and (Sanskrit) literature, this parallel crop of men were producing material that was ‘awful in its ethnocentric bigotry’, casting Hindus as a class of infant-murdering, wife-burning debauchees, in desperate need of reform. If anything, India and its Hindus existed to prove the West’s superiority.

--- 
Grant’s attack was a veritable chutney of old stereotypes that had long been circulating. But while he did damage, his views were not swallowed willingly. The Company, as before, had to balance ‘the world of domestic politics’ in Britain along with ‘the world of British India’. London was not against missionary activities in principle, which is why, even as Grant was decrying Hinduism in Britain, his countrymen in India were—as we saw—sponsoring temple festivals, giving gifts to deities, mimicking rajahs, peddling ‘Hindu law’ and otherwise attempting to construct a bargain with ‘natives’. Besides, Europe was unsettled after the French Revolution, and some feared that spreading Christian ideas in India risked also transmitting notions of liberty: a threat to British power.

---
Evangelical Christianity conceived of each individual as a means for spiritual and social rejuvenation. One did not need to be a priest or a churchman; Britain was urbanizing, with an expanding working class, evangelicalism being a response to ‘the emergence of modern urban society’; a novel form of faith for novel times, where spiritual authority was no longer the preserve of the church.

---
In the peninsula, governed from Madras, European missionaries had become a fixture over previous centuries, so official attitudes were relatively relaxed. But given that vending faith was a lower priority than trading goods and keeping order, much depended on individual officers’ attitudes.

---
As renewal of the Company’s charter approached in 1813, the evangelical party saw a fresh window. Using all its organizational muscle, the movement was able to excite public support for the ‘pious clause’. India had to be ‘saved’. Parliamentarians also, observing the growth of the ‘religious public’, for political self-interest felt they had to be mollified. And the missionary camp won: The Company’s latest charter featured a clause on ‘religious and moral improvement’. The British were, from now on required to afford, officially, ‘sufficient facilities’ in India to all who wished to aid this cause. As Pennington said, 'Much of the missionaries’ polemical engagements with Hindus had something to do with their own fight for legitimacy.’ 

---
How did this turnaround occur? An important contributor was missionary publications. The appeal of this kind of literature is clear: It entertained and shocked, but most importantly, underlined the belief that the British—with the Bible—were obliged to lift up the world. Christianizing India was not equated with liberating India; vassals of Britain they were, and as such they would continue—only now in the good books of god. And indeed, Indians who converted often found that Europeans did not treat them as equals.

What is instructive here, though, is that even in defending Hindus, friendly white men resorted to cliché and familiar tropes. Indomaniacs romanticized the country, focusing on texts and ideas; those peddling Indophobia picked on the most outrageous, ‘exotic’ aspects of practice to make their case. The spectrum of ideas and practice, and their constant negotiations and intertwined coexistence, was lost amid these stark posts, and in this lay the beginnings of what would guide most future understandings of Hinduism. 

---

Hinduism, as it was imagined now, had no history, it could not be dynamic and it could not have evolved, or be subject to diversity. It was either this or that. Faced with harassment, Hinduism would acquire a new, defensive avatar. Christianity laid the ground on which Hindus constructed their defence. Hinduism would, in key respects, be Christianized, internalizing that distinction between what was ‘good’ within and what ‘bad’. Debates would begin among ‘natives’ on ‘true’ Hinduism and mass ‘corruption’. They too would jettison the amorphous spectrum, reimagining faith as a defensible monolith; as a fortified, Protestant Hinduism.

---
Interestingly, however, the 1813 victory in Parliament for the missionary lobby was incomplete. For the new clause still upheld ‘the authority of the local Governments’ in filtering European access to India. The propaganda war, therefore, continued even after 1813. This, interestingly, had its peculiar economics, demonstrating how much Indian affairs were dictated by domestic events in Britain. The associations and societies involved in the evangelical cause functioned in one market. By the middle of the nineteenth century, several boasted high revenues.

Tales from India, with tragic widows, pagan customs, blood sacrifices and more were a way to hook interest. Illustrations began to appear in missionary publications, to sustain the reader’s animation. Missionary writings were not an exercise in academic comparison but a venture to expand the ‘religious public’: the economic and political backbone for evangelicalism. This, in fact, handicapped voices resisting the onslaught: Their focus on texts and ideas—as seen in the Vindication —could convince discerning readers but not the broader mass. A subcontinent, with a formidable range of customs and beliefs, much debate and disagreement, was reduced, in this way, to an inventory of violent but arresting stereotypes.

Perhaps the most damaging of this literary surge was James Mill’s three-volume The History of British India (1817)—a ‘judging history’ he published without once setting foot in the country it decried. The scholarly foundation of Mill’s critique, in fact, was works which had come into circulation from that period—writings we know were garbled and full of limitations. Unsurprisingly, with imperfect sources, Mill’s conclusions too were deformed. It was this ‘reliable’ information—which most Hindus would not have recognized—that the man used to lambast them, both in the past and present. He might as well have cited historical fiction.

--- 

As the ‘religious public’ grew at home, men reared within began to populate Company ranks, carrying evangelical motives into the state machinery. Missionaries, in fact, actively began to locate sympathizers in government, adjusting strategies in India accordingly. More generally, debates on India and evangelicalism had formed the backdrop during formative years for an increasing number of officers. The use of Company officials and troops in organizing temple celebrations—requiring vast numbers of peasants to be commandeered—generated uneasiness. Over the coming years, the state withdrew from the religious space: Small village shrines were handed over to priests, larger ones to local committees, major pilgrim centres to influential community leaders and so on. Everything that, earlier in the century, was construed as a small price to pay for power was now considered wicked. The British no longer felt any incentive to fit the ‘native’s’ world; it was the ‘native’ who had to reconcile to rescripted rules.

--- 
Understandably, wrath towards missionaries was on the ascendant in Hindu circles, especially among high-caste groups. In the south, Catholics were not as much of a fear—de Nobili’s strategies were still in place—but Protestants, backed by power and ‘more aggressive’ in tone, looked a threat. Remarkably, even at this late date, dislike for Protestant reverends stemmed from the insistence that Christianity was the only path to god. The whole of the Hindu world was built on plurality. The Christian picture of things, however, seemed totalitarian. And their unyielding stance triggered Indian restlessness.

---
Naturally, many on the ‘native’ side now prepared to resist. Hindu–missionary debates, in fact, became grand spectacles, watched by heaps of people. A transition to print did not terminate public disputations; this was symptomatic of a new dynamic in India: the political fight between ‘native’ and colonizer. Talk of faith did not, that is, emerge in a vacuum, and debates around it were merely an outlet for a veritable basket of grievances.

Indians were devouring texts to ‘expand their minds, and fill their heads with knowledge’, not least of which was the language of political rights. And given that these ideas were penetrating ‘native’ skulls without a simultaneous Christianization of the soul, it could only have heinous consequences. Just as British officials and missionaries enlisted moral jargon to back their claims, Hindus here brought forth their readings of principle to attack the enemy. To this, of course, were added points of public interest, such as taxes, but the glue binding them was emotion. And emotional union—or at least a simulation of it—with Indians was the Company’s perennial infirmity.

--- 

In the end, as is well known, the country saw widespread rebellion in 1857. The British would later infantilize ‘natives’ by dismissing the revolt as provoked by the supply of cartridges greased with animal fat—of cows and pigs—thereby upsetting Hindu and Muslim ‘prejudices’. Viewed this way, the rebellion was carnage by an irrational people lashing out over a triviality. But the fact is that the cartridges were merely the match that lit the fire; powder had been accumulating for years. Hindus and Muslims were one in this—they had been wronged. And the villain of the piece, of course, was the white man.

#### SIX ‘NATIVE LUTHERS’
##### Chapter Summary: 

##### Highlights 

#### Raja Ram Mohun Roy 
Ram Mohun Roy would—from within Hindu society—seek to set off a Reformation of sorts. This was, in his mind, the only way Hindus could navigate modernity. Here, however, European influences are visible in the form of prevailing orientalist wisdom that ‘true’ Hinduism could be located only in its ancient, authentic Sanskrit texts. And that all customs not ‘imperatively enjoined’ by such sources were open to reform. Just as evangelicals in Britain nurtured a ‘religious public’, that is, reformers like Roy were cultivating one in India: a class that in time would also glaze their Hindu identity with nationalism.

---
The goal, then, was twofold: to teach Hindus that their religion, as it existed , was not actually their religion; and to persuade Europeans—as exemplified by James Mill and William Ward, whose notorious works appeared in the same years—that they had misjudged Hinduism. This was, patently, a top-down reading of faith: a marriage of a Western conception of what any religion ought to look like (such as the emphasis on scripture) with the slant of a Brahmin synthesizing European and ‘native’ ideas. Except that in this case, what was a fluid system, which in its ability to absorb all manner of cults and beliefs had plural origins, hastened its move towards regimentation, with a one-source pedigree—and this time not in writings by foreigners.

---
It was not, to be clear, the ‘invention’ of a new faith. The process, besides, was afoot ever since Hindus encountered Islam. But for all that, Hinduism had stayed an amorphous system, until colonialism and evangelical perils inspired some Hindus to espouse a firmer outline. Modern Hinduism was not, then, as some argue, a synthetic British construct. It was nevertheless a fresh incarnation, necessitated by political and social crises. Reformers could find justification for Hinduism’s rebranding within the Hindu tradition; as we saw in the Introduction, this was a constantly transforming, responsive universe. Or in the words of a later writer, ‘As knowledge grows, our theology develops.' The Sanskrit corpus, as we know, is capacious enough that, with a bit of flexibility, evidence for everything might be discovered in it. 

---
What Roy preferred was the Upanishads—philosophical ruminations, themselves diverse, and which had received orientalist praise —from which he harvested lines to manufacture a tidy profile for Hinduism. Of course, he made errors and his knowledge of the Vedas was incomplete. But few could tell. And in any case, this selective reading of scripture—embracing some bits, excising others—was never just a spiritual matter; it was political. It is also not, therefore, a minor detail that Roy was perhaps the first Hindu to appropriate ‘Hinduism’ as a term and label in his writings. 

Ironically, this was the missionary method too: to pick and choose whatever pushed pet ideas, But more directly, Roy, like Protestants, placed scripture over ‘custom and accumulated tradition’.

---
Having accepted the premise of Hinduism’s decline from unparalleled purity, Roy had to explain how this happened. And here, he parked blame with Brahmins. He accused Brahmins of veiling monotheism from the masses and declared that Brahmins pushed the ‘absurdity of idolatry’ for selfish ‘comforts and fortune’, hiding what really mattered: ‘knowledge of their scriptures’.

And finally, he attacked Puranic Hinduism and its gods. Krishna, he declared, committed unholy acts with women; Siva’s (phallic) icon was so ‘indecent’, it was ‘impossible’ to describe ‘in language fit to meet the public eye’; Kali was singularly unladylike, with her taste for ‘wine, criminal intercourse, and licentious songs’. The Upanishads, he announced, saw ‘polytheism with contempt’. We note that such attacks on Hindu gods occurred more in Roy’s English writings than in the Bengali. 

---
The legitimacy Roy’s ideas gained suggests that enough Hindus did welcome his interpretation. In other words, he was filling a genuinely felt gap; Hinduism’s extant avatar opened it to attack, and as national feelings grew, room for such criticism had to be eliminated. Besides, much of what Roy said was familiar. The perception of image worship as a subordinate practice came from the ninth-century philosopher, Sankara; Roy’s anti-idol stance was anticipated 600 years before in the south by Basava; Brahminical ritualism, which Roy disparaged, was attacked in western India as far back as the fourteenth century by thinkers like Namdev.

As Suvira Jaiswal notes, in Hinduism ‘orthodoxy is to be proved in the realm of ritual and social behaviour’ such as caste practices, temple worship, etc., ‘but there is no such insistence in the realm of ideas’. Roy, that is, could believe what he wanted—so long as he did not attack the practice of Hinduism. 

---
And yet, there was a difference from older intellectual stances. Basava lampooned idolatry but challenged claims of Vedic supremacy too: Roy’s veneration of the Upanishads would not have appealed to this medieval forebear. Namdev and the bhakti poets believed in a devotional culture, often focused on a humanized god, not just divinity in the abstract—this too would have made Roy fret. Sankara’s prescriptions on finding the formless god were for the ‘ascetic and [Brahmin] intellectual’, while our nineteenth-century man urged it on Hindus in toto; here again was dissonance.

Even if these ideas had swirled about, it was the combination of colonialism, modernity and the Christian threat that helped chisel them into a uniform, formal Hinduism. Roy’s political genius lay in erecting a serious obstacle in the missionary’s path: a new ‘ancient’ Hindu alternative to Christianity, which rendered conversion theoretically—as well as theologically—redundant.

---
Robert Caldwell's quote:

> . . . it is the peculiar policy of the Brahmans to render all religious systems of India subservient to their purpose by making friends of them all. Brahmanism repudiates exclusiveness; it incorporates all creeds, assimilates all, consecrates all. People are permitted to entertain any opinions they please, and to practice any ceremonies they please, provided only that the supremacy of the Vedas and of the Brahmans is duly acknowledged. When that acknowledgment has been duly made, the new heterodoxy becomes another new authoritative orthodoxy, especially revealed by the Supreme Being himself for the enlightenment and salvation of the particular class of people amongst whom it has become popular. Thus Brahmanism yields and conquers; and hence, though the demon worship of Tinnevelly is as far as possible repugnant to the genius of orthodox Hinduism, and was not only independent of it in origin but, as I believe, long anterior to it, yet even it has received a place in the cunningly-devised mosaic of the Brahmans, and the devils have got themselves regarded as abnormal developments of the gods. 

---
To Hindus, variety had been normal; their religious world was, as one scholar put it, like a Venn diagram of overlapping experiences. This was not proof of decay, as missionaries, orientalists and Roy believed, but an organic reflection of history. By the nineteenth century, however, new norms prevailed, demanding consistency. Roy blunted the Christian threat to Hinduism. Between 1820 and 1823, Roy published much on Christianity, reiterating his stance from the *Tuhfat* . Jesus’s moral teachings, he pronounced, deserved praise; all beyond that, such as miracles, was nonsense. By subjecting Christian scripture to analysis, to sustained interrogation by reason, and interpreting it on his terms, this brown man reversed what Europeans did to ‘native’ religious literature. Roy’s strategy, that is, allowed Hinduism to hold its own in a changed, unequal world—and in key respects, to turn the tables.

---

#### Dayananda Saraswati

Dayananda Saraswati (1824–83), on the other hand, became a reformer within Hinduism—yet another ‘Luther of India’. Dayananda’s espousal of a Hinduism anchored in the Vedas, and there is no reason to disbelieve it. But what is interesting is that this view emerged not from any direct exposure to the British or familiarity with orientalist scholarship; it came from a deep and genuine disillusionment with the world as it was, and Puranic Hinduism’s inadequacy to supply solutions. This is linked to a larger phenomenon: that ‘traditional’ Hinduism too was a dynamic space, not a frozen monolith; it had figures within clamouring for change, even if they did not transact in English.

---
Contemporary to Dayananda, was the Tamil Saiva saint Ramalinga (1823–74). He was not concerned with a uniform, purified Hinduism; instead, his focus was modernising Saivism. For him, Tamil, the common man’s tongue, was preferable to elite Sanskrit. Indeed, he even invented new forms of temple ceremony, thus countering the idea that ritual and tradition are unchanging. Ramalinga’s work was also reform—born, though, with little foreign stimulus.

So also, in Orissa, there emerged the Mahima Dharma, described by the end of the nineteenth century as a cult of ‘Hindu dissenters’. Its founder, Mahima Swami, first arrived in the region in the 1820s but became a prominent teacher only three-and-a-half decades, winning followers among tribes and low-caste groups—sections disenfranchised by prevailing Brahminical high culture.

---
Dayananda, unlike many non-cosmopolitan Hindu religious leaders, brought an added quality to the equation: an entrepreneurial eye to widen his venture beyond implicit limits. The core of his Hinduism—Arya Dharma , faith of the Aryans—was the Vedas, He studied the Yajur Veda, in keeping with family convention. 116 His rule was simple: ‘Whatever was not to be found in the Vedas . . . [was] false and useless; whatever was found in the Vedas,’ on the contrary, was ‘beyond the reach of controversy.’ That is, the only area where Dayananda was unyieldingly dogmatic was Vedic infallibility.

But where his Bengali prior Roy built on the (chronologically later) Upanishads, Dayananda preferred the Samhitas: the oldest section, with its hymns. The Upanishads were acceptable, of course, so long as they did not contradict earlier parts; and if one admitted they were not divine revelation but appendices of human authorship. But what, then, of deities catalogued in the Samhitas? To Dayananda, these were not gods, just aspects of the almighty—an interpretation critics attacked as sophistry, to conceal polytheistic values. Additionally, he viewed most other scriptural sources as ‘false’: the Puranas provoked Dayananda’s ‘contempt’, for example, because they represented decline. Like Roy, his tirade against Puranic Hinduism aligns with missionary views: Worshipping Siva through the lingam, he argued, was ‘an act of barbarians’; the Vaishnavas’ claims of divine incarnations were not only nonsense but an insult to intelligence.

He castigated Christianity too, as well as Jainism and Islam. Dayananda, in fact, blamed this class for spreading idolatry in India. By the 1870s, in other words, the man who earlier worked in a relatively slim professional space, engaging with Sanskrit pandits, grew cognizant of a wider religious public. He realized also that besides restoring ‘pure’ Hinduism among Hindus, he would have to also preserve it actively from encroachment by non -Hindus.

---
For Dayananda, this transition had much to do with a visit to Calcutta earlier in that decade. What made all the difference was an encounter with Roy’s successors at the Brahmo Samaj. 

In 1874, he went to Bombay, where his own venture, the Arya Samaj, was founded.

---
‘His long and mostly fruitless efforts’ in pilgrim towns in upper India had, we discover, taught Dayananda ‘that the regeneration of Hinduism would not be effected through pandits and the brahmins: they had too big a stake in the status quo’. Instead, urban elites—men walking in Roy’s footsteps—were more receptive to new ideas and fresh interpretations of old ones. In fact, Dayananda had an advantage over Roy when it came to winning supporters. He was at a glance a Hindu ascetic: This endowed him with a degree of general reverence wherever he went. Secondly, he travelled extensively and had lived among the people.

But most critically, Dayananda’s openness to learning from the urban reformist set, and blending it with his own mission, brought him long-awaited success. His idea of Hinduism was sculpted originally with his blind guru in ‘traditional’ settings, but he adopted strategies of the ‘modern’ city reformers in marketing that idea. In fact, as he became aware of Western technology, Dayananda pinned these also to his favourite texts: a step that permitted him to scorn foreign advances, while nevertheless appropriating them for Hindus. All the ‘sciences and arts’ in ‘the whole world’ had ‘their original start’ in Vedic minds. Future writers would put this down to an inferiority complex, Stubbornly dismissing all criticism, then, Dayananda clung to his view that the Vedas were the source of everything.

--- 
Boosted by growing success, in the second half of the 1870s, Dayananda developed a political project: a renaissance backed by India’s Hindu princes. After all, even if the British ruled 60 per cent of the country, the rest was under the control of ‘native’ royalty. And properly directed, these men—who owned resources and social capital—could do much to propel Dayananda’s vision.

But if rousing princes—a proposition Hindu nationalists would again consider a half-century later—failed, Dayananda had success galvanizing ordinary people towards action. That is, he began identifying causes with the potential to unite Hindus, otherwise fragmented into castes and sects. The cow offered itself here as an option: castes, middling and high, all held the animal sacred, and Dayananda urged them to proactively protect it. Reverence for the cow also had the benefit of separating not only the beef-eating British but also Muslims from Hindus.

In 1882, Dayananda also highlighted the cow’s emotional appeal, founding the Gaurakshini Sabha (‘Cow-Protection Association’), members of which turned public squares into pulpits. Understandably, this provoked violence with Muslims, while also serving as a means to coerce ‘bad’ Hindus—beef-eating low castes—into turning ‘good’ by accepting Brahminical values.

---
Dayananda’s message—despite feuds between his moderate and radical followers—found welcome with millions. On the one hand, it crafted a middle-class Hinduism, especially in Punjab and upper India. Or as a commentator put it, it was the faith of the ‘minor civil servants, schoolmasters, local pleaders, medical practitioners, and other active citizens’. On the other, it positioned itself as ‘an effective competitor to [Christian] missions’, ‘dogging the missionary movement, copying its organizations . . . and countering its strategies at every turn’.

Most significantly, shuddhi (purification) schemes were developed, to re-convert those who departed Hinduism for Christianity or Islam. In 1913, 9000 persons, thus, were reclaimed in Jammu; in 1923, 15,000 in Rajputana followed.

--- 
Viewed another way, where Roy set the stage with a theoretical basis for defending Hinduism, Dayananda went a step further: He became the grandfather of a mass-based Hindu nationalism. There was only one problem, though, blocking the rise of this new politicized Hindu identity. And the name of that problem was caste. For if Hindus were internally a divided people, how could they unite in the face of external foes like the missionary?

---
#### Jyotirao Phule


Phule’s life, in fact, exemplifies one of those little discussed consequences of colonialism in India: the political mobilization of subordinate castes, which successfully utilized British rule to bargain for just treatment from their traditional superiors. As rulers, white men preferred courting elite Hindus exclusively, seeing in them ideal consumers of Western learning. For missionaries, meanwhile, schools were an instrument for conversion, not a charitable scheme to produce local reformers. Exposing ‘natives’ to Western science came with the expectation that they would ‘lose confidence in [their] own religion’,

But as often happens, the results of such plans did not match their sponsors’ calculations. Refashioning these to alter arrangements within the Hindu world. Phule, though no enemy of conversion, was one such beneficiary. He learnt from missionaries but adapted their strategies to his own anti-caste activism. The window colonialism opened for change, not least by way of criminal law which did not discriminate between castes.

---
Political freedom as urged by (mostly) high-caste thinkers lost its appeal; instead, social liberation seemed more urgent. The chains Phule wished to throw off were caste, superstition and Hinduism itself—by which he meant the ‘selfish counterfeit faith’ of the Brahmins. Men like Dayananda, while acknowledging its flaws, never rejected caste itself, Phule was allergic to the very principle. It came from two different ways of viewing the world.

But appeals to the public required more than just a rationalistic argument if they were to excite action; they needed emotional stimulants. Which meant Phule had to also tell a story with heroes and villains. Where nationalists pointed to the British as the bad men, our reformer found his antagonists in Brahmins. To him, in fact, this class was the personification of all that was evil in Hindu society.

As such, this position has a history. Tamil Saiva saints, for example, did not hesitate to take a similar stand in medieval times. Phule, however, hoped to unite all non-Brahmin groups under a common label—Sudras. Critically, in the process he would redefine the idea of being ‘native’. Simply stated, the entire lot of people now subject to the British could not claim this tag. It applied, he argued, only to non-Brahmins. Or to cite Savitribai, Sudras alone were India’s true ‘natives’. Indeed, Hindus had reason to be grateful for foreign rule; if, Phule declared, they had learnt humaneness despite living in the toxic world of caste, it was thanks to white men.

---
In what is equally interesting, while Phule attacked the ‘higher’ Hindu gods, he presented folk deities like Khandoba—venerated chiefly by non-Brahmins—as historical heroes, deified for resisting Aryans during those early days of conflict. Importantly, this set Phule apart from other subaltern reformers of the day. 

In Travancore, for example, Narayana Guru (1856–1928) rose as spiritual leader to the Ezhavas: a populous but ‘polluting’ community. His most famous maxim: that there is only one caste (humanity), one religion and one god. He established ‘counter temples’ for low-caste groups. Yet, unlike Phule, Guru’s reforms entailed a degree of Sanskritization, including adopting the habits of high-caste Hindus; it was not a total defiance of Brahminical authority. Guru’s reform lay in rejecting Brahminism as a social practice, while democratizing Brahminical Hinduism.

 This was not Phule’s style; nobody could transform him into a conventional guru. To obtain social justice, Phule was willing to subordinate political liberty.

---
In Madras it would be found in the last decade of Phule’s life, that of 1346 graduates, almost nine hundred were Brahmins. Even in schools, Brahmin teachers could not sympathize with non-Brahmin pupils. Phule’s younger contemporary, B.G. Tilak (1856–1920), later to become a leading nationalist, resisted all that Phule urged. Educating girls risked ‘castrating’ Hinduism. So also, Tilak was against educating all castes, seeing in it the threat of cultural ‘destruction’; the shattering of ‘reverence’ towards Brahmins and orthodox Hinduism.

---
As the twentieth century approached, Hinduism and Hindus were in a state of flux. Many felt that pressure for change, both to resist colonialism and to forge a nation. But ‘Hindu reformers and publicists disagreed with each other on the constituents of reformed Hinduism.’

On the one hand, thanks to men like Roy, there was an intellectual, philosophical picture, particularly useful when framing Hinduism as a coherent world religion before Western audiences. It was this Hinduism, for instance, that the monk Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902) highlighted at the 1893 World’s Parliament of Religions in Chicago to great applause. 

Then there was emergent Hindu nationalism, as represented in its early form by Dayananda’s followers, actively rousing men to action in service of the cow and in opposition to Muslims and missionaries. Here, we find a more aggressive Hinduism, unafraid to soil its hands, and dismissive of intellectual views as defined on Western terms.

But there was also contradiction in efforts to unify Hindus, as appears in Phule’s anti-caste activism. This spotlighted cleavages within Hindu society. Viewed from this prism, Roy’s romanticized Hinduism was a façade; the reality was less beautiful. Nationalism too, this school of thought would suggest, was a mischievous effort to subdue the low castes; an overplaying of the British threat to nip internal revolution. And as the Hindu identity consolidated itself, successors of Phule like B.R. Ambedkar—who would give India its post-colonial constitution—were ever present to point to its paradoxes.

The advent of a nationalized Hindu identity, then, was riddled with inconsistences. So, in the end it would take another generation before a Hindu ideologue identified a means to transcend these; to draw a vision of ‘Hinduness’ to surmount its most gaping infirmities.

#### DRAWING BLOOD
##### Chapter Summary: 

##### Highlights 

#### Bala Gangadhar Tilak
By 1918, Tilak was being nervously described as ‘probably the most powerful man in India’, having even won international approbation from the likes of Lenin. Tilak died in 1920, and leadership of the nationalist movement was transferred from the lokamanya into the hands of a certain mahatma. Gandhi had returned to India after years abroad in 1915, preaching passive resistance and nonviolence—neither of which propositions amused Tilak.

---
Centuries before Tilak, there lived in the Maharashtra region a Brahmin sage called Ramdas (1608–81). He had wisdom to impart on god and matters of the soul, but what most appealed to later-day nationalists were his political lessons. Ramdas promoted the cult of power. He commanded the Marathas to unite, spread their authority and bring order. Patent here, however, was also a fusing of politics with religion: The enemy represented Islamic might, whereas resistance was Hindu

---
But if Ramdas offered an intellectual frame for militant Hinduism, the real icon—the man who manifested it in action—was the contemporary Maratha king, Chhatrapati Shivaji (1630–80). Kingship is more than bald power; it requires an ideological foundation. As a non-Muslim, he could not appropriate the sultanate model, so the would-be king fell back on Hindu traditions, claiming space on fresh terms. In 1674, he organized a grand ‘classical’ coronation rite—of the like not seen for centuries. 

In this reading, Shivaji was no rebel, but an idealized Kshatriya monarch, restoring order after a long eclipse. This countering of Islamic power structures with a Sanskritic one also accommodated his newness. Muslims as a people were not Shivaji’s enemies, but as the founder of a new political entity and a consciously Hindu kingship, Islamic power was undesirable; the new space he was creating was ‘accessible to all’, sure, but would be ‘governed by Hindus’—a development which in due course offered Hindu nationalists a genealogy for their creed. More broadly, for Tilak’s generation, Shivaji’s example could be marshalled for resistance to the British.

---
This overlap between a politically alert Hinduism and nationalism was particularly pronounced in Tilak’s early career. Congress, to him, looked like an elite talking shop; to grow fiercer, he urged a sustained outreach to ordinary people, in forms and an idiom they could identify with. Tilak’s plan to achieve this was to moor modern political freedoms and institutions in ‘native’ cultural ideas. And the way he would do this—to the discomfiture of many of his peers—was by injecting religion into nationalism.

His first was focused on the elephant-headed Ganapati, venerated as much by Brahmins as by non-Brahmins. This made the deity a compelling candidate to construct ‘harmony amongst various sections of the Hindu community’. What was mostly a private worship, thus, was turned from 1893 into a public celebration. This was not about god but kindling public energy; fun and play was a vehicle for ‘imparting [political] knowledge’.

The second event Tilak launched was an annual commemoration of Shivaji: a hero on whom too ‘all the different castes of Maharashtra could focus their loyalty’. Tilak, however, transformed the king into a totem for mass mobilization. A supporter’s letter published in the *Kesari* (Tilak's Marathi newspaper) explained, Shivaji was to Maharashtra ‘what George Washington was to the United States of America’—a symbol of who his people were, and what they must fight for. A decade later, it was even clearer that Ganapati celebrations served as an ‘occasion of demonstrations against the British’ while the ‘cult of Shivaji’ was ‘an incitement to the expulsion of English rule’. The king, from a faceless outline in traditional tales, made his entry into thousands of Maharashtra homes this way, enveloped in history but also political sentiment.

Urging all to ‘consider the actions of great men’ in conceiving resistance, he called on them to escape the shackles of mere legality. For this, the Gita was pointed to—that religious text of orientalist delight.

---
In the government’s eyes, he was likely ‘the chief conspirator, against the existence of the British’ in India. They could never find convincing proof, though, of Tilak’s links to revolutionaries.

*****

India, it was manifest—with its variety of identities, castes and languages—could never be a case study in homogeneity. How then to foster nationalism? Where Tilak was concerned, the solution lay in tethering the proposition to Hinduism; to cultivate a Hindu nationalism. Moderate Congressmen’s views that everyone living in India was automatically part of an Indian nation was not convincing. Or as he explained, to view ‘Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Parsis’ and others as a unity was wrong; to claim ‘their nationality has become one’ was simplistic. No mere ‘aggregation of people’ residing together constituted ‘a nation’. For the genuine article one needed ‘such bonds as a common language, a common religion, and a common history’. The harsh truth to be faced, then, was that the ‘majority of our society’ was Hindu. And though internally diverse, Hindus all shared a palpable ‘feeling of Hindutva (Hinduness)’. This, therefore, must be the glue with which to activate nationalism. The Victorian tenet was that India was a dispersed ‘assemblage of beings’. But for Tilak, the great bulk of those beings converged under that great tent called Hinduism. By ‘forgetting all the minor differences’, it would be possible to secure them into a ‘mighty Hindu nation’. And naturally, ‘the prosperity which we want must come about by means of a Hindu state’. After all, as Tilak explained, the very name ‘Hindustan’ for India originated in the fact that this was the Hindu homeland. Contradictions within did not matter; ‘pride in the Hindu religion’ could convert most Indians into a forceful bloc.

To count as Hindu, one had to satisfy only a few requirements: acknowledge Vedic supremacy; accept that there are multiple paths to god; and that god did not open only one door to mankind through a single prophet or messenger but appeared in a host of forms. It is striking how much of this matched what Hindus had always stated in their encounters with missionaries.

Interestingly, he did not romanticize Vedic revivalism of the Arya Samaj type; in fact, wrote the lokamanya, Hinduism had survived the ages precisely by being open to change, sometimes even incorporating features from rival traditions. Luther was offered as a model—the German called for transformation, yes, but remained a devout Christian. ‘Native’ Luthers too, then, were legitimate only if they worked within the limits of Hindu nationalist interests.

---
That said, Tilak’s Hindutva or Hinduness was largely still an academic portrait. As late as 1911, for instance, in swathes of upper India, census officials would find that ‘a quarter of the persons classed as Hindus denied’ both ‘supremacy of the brahmans and the authority of the Vedas’. Even with cow worship, two-fifths ate beef. So in terms of practical mobilization, Hinduness was reinforced by emphasizing not what Hindus were but what they were not: Christian and Muslim.

Besides Christianity, the Hindu nation was also besieged by Islam. At one level, it appears that the conservative Brahmin in Tilak was not fond of interfaith overlaps—what looked happily syncretic from one gaze resembled adulteration from another. Patent here is the idea that Hindus were ‘the people’; others might be tolerated, provided they accepted Hindu priority. 

---
Hindus were owning their separateness, and openly too. At its core the tension was this: Though Hindus were numerically stronger, a history of Islamic rule, combined with Hinduism’s many-faced, flexible and splintered nature evidently gave Islamic culture a wide berth. Flexing Hinduness became critical, while highlighting the fundamental irreconcilability of the Islamic and Hindu identities. The goal in mind was Hindu consolidation—step one towards Hindu nationalism. In a critic’s words, Tilak ‘grafted a new hatred of British rule on to the old hatred of Mohammedan domination’.

In time, Hindu nationalists would expand this approach, so that in addition to foreign foes, Hindus were asked to beware of the (supposed) enemy within. The underlying message was this: If India were seized from Hindus, its proprietorship must also return in time to Hindus exclusively.

---
In 1920, on the other hand, the crowd’s mood was shifting. At a pan-Indian level, Tilak had in fact mellowed over the years, gaining wider acceptability. The man went from being a polarizing politician to projecting a statesmanlike image. His desire to energize Hindus remained, but in the fight against the British, Muslim cooperation, he realized, was unavoidable. Tilak was prepared to recognize all who exerted themselves for ‘the good of India’ as ‘not alien’. Hindus were intrinsically Indian, of course. He had begun an inveterate Hindu nationalist but necessity blunted his sharp edges.

However, with social reform, his position was less elastic: The Hindu religion and rashtra (nation) were ‘more important than social reforms. And here—especially when it came to questions of caste inequality—Hindutva looked fragile. One point of friction was Brahmin domination of the bureaucratic job market. As we saw, Brahmins had emerged across India as suppliers of administrative talent.

---
In 1888, in provinces attached to Madras and Bombay, out of 625 senior posts, 413 were with Brahmins. If in these parts they constituted less than 5 per cent of Hindu males, they yet controlled not less than 60 per cent of offices. As non-Brahmins demanded a share, Brahmins felt threatened. That is, in equations between Hindus, the lokamanya’s calls for equality appeared to go on vacation. Here, every now and then, a jealous Brahminness eclipsed his grand project of Hinduness.

In leading political resistance too, whether it was Tilak on the more pugilistic side, or figures in the Congress’s moderate wing, Brahmins were at the forefront in Maharashtra. By 1910, in fact, the Bombay government would diversify its hiring practices to avoid overreliance on this set.

Tilak clashed also with the Kolhapur maharajah, descended from Shivaji. It began with a feud over ritual: Brahmins had denied the prince Vedic rites (permitted to Kshatriyas), admitting only lower Puranic options (open to women and Sudras). Shahu II (1874–1922) saw this as an affront. And for all his talk of uniting Hindus, Tilak sided with the mulish orthodox party.

Shahu II responded by clipping Brahmin influence: From 1902, half of all government appointments in Kolhapur were reserved for non-Brahmins. In Baroda, Sayajirao—who too was denied Kshatriya rank—enacted similar measures.

---
In the immediate aftermath of the lokamanya’s death, then, it looked like Hindutva was coming apart. Indeed, non-Brahmin radicals turned Tilak’s playbook against him. By the middle of the new decade, they too organized festivals, with the difference that images of Phule and Shahu were paraded alongside Shivaji’s. The broader point—which disturbs Hindu nationalism to this day—remained: that seams of Hindu unity, loose to begin with, risked coming undone in the face of domestic caste dissension

Tilak need not have worried, though. For despite all this public warring—between the ideas of secular nationalism and Hindu majoritarianism, Brahmins and non-Brahmins—the pursuit of Hinduness sustained itself. Indeed, Tilak’s opponents appropriated this concept too, just as they took his strategies of mobilization. Naturally, this Hindutva was unlike Tilak’s.

The 1920s non-Brahmins accepted only one category, though: that of Hindus without distinctions. To be part of the Hindu nation, they argued—marrying Phule’s anti-casteism with Tilakite cultural nationalism—caste must be rejected and equality embraced. Hinduness could not be trotted in and out selectively; it must demolish internal biases as vigorously as it fought external foes.

#### Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (1883–1966)

In Nasik, Savarkar had participated with enthusiasm in the Shivaji and Ganapati festivals, clashing with Muslim boys at school, and once vandalizing a mosque. In Poona for higher studies, Savarkar had enrolled in Fergusson College, of which Tilak was a founder. Here he set up a secret society called Abhinav Bharat.

---
In London, Savarkar was arrested and when the verdict came, his sentence added up to half a century in prison, effectively meaning that the next time the twenty-six-year-old could walk free, he would be approaching eighty. In the end, Savarkar spent over a decade in the Andamans, where slowly his revolutionary urges wilted.

*****

This next chapter of Savarkar’s story begins in 1924. For many, it remains a puzzle that Savarkar should become a proponent of Hindu nationalism. Yes, as a teenager, he got into scuffles with Muslims, but as a man, his patriotism looked inclusive. In his book on 1857, for instance, he urged a concord between Hindus and their Muslim countrymen. In Shivaji’s day, when Islamic rule troubled Hindus, a ‘feeling of hatred’ was ‘just’; today, however, he explained, it would be ‘foolish’.*

Savarkar of his twenties believed in a nationalism that welcomed all Indians. India belonged to ‘whoever is born there’. As a stance, it even matched Gandhi’s and that of Congress moderates. Savarkar in his forties was a different man, however; and Hindus, in his mind, were not just the largest of all communities with a stake in the nation but sole claimants to its title deed. This argument appeared first in his *Essentials of Hindutva*, smuggled out of prison in 1923, and today, a century later, ‘the de facto bible of militant and exclusionary Hindu nationalism’

In defining Hindutva, his terms were disarmingly simple: India must be one’s fatherland, or the home of one’s ancestors, but it must equally be one’s ‘holyland’: the country of one’s faith and all it held sacred. By this measure, Saivas, Vaishnavas, Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs and so on were invariably Hindu, even if only the first two recognised Hinduism. Muslims and Christians, however, were barred. Yes, India was their homeland, and they shared blood with brown men; but their ‘holylands’ were in ‘Arabia or Palestine’. This meant ‘[t]heir love is divided’.

---
Essentials, he achieved something far more powerful and practical than Tilak’s Hindutva. The lokamanya, ultimately, presented the idea in religious terms such as loyalty to the Vedas. But this begged the question: What was Hinduism? Was it Brahminism compressed into Sanskrit manuscripts? Was it temple culture, which sat at odds with Dayananda’s ‘true’ faith? Or was it the distilled philosophy men like Ram Mohun Roy advertised to the West? And what of the contradictory customs that had no basis in any texts, existing unshakeably in the realm of habit only? With Hinduism itself not amenable to easy or uniform definition, any Hindutva constructed on its back would be—and was—contested.

But Savarkar, skirting these issues, anchored his ideas in history: If philosophy, he once wrote, tended to make one question life’s purpose, history felt empowering in pulling through life. And his Hindutva was designed to empower, built not on faith therefore but on a shared past. It did not matter if you were Brahmin or non-Brahmin; it made no difference if you worshipped tribal deities with blood or poured sanctified milk over Brahminical gods. You might even fight one another in terms of caste and theology. But so long as you shared blood as well as a sacred attachment to India—not Mecca or Rome—you were Hindu: heirs to a single heritage and one personality

To enable this, Savarkar naturally purveyed the past not as a scholar but as an ideologue. And where that shared past, so essential to his formulation, did not exist, it was made to exist. History, in his books, that is, appears not in its own context or on its own terms but as raw fodder to support a predetermined position (which in and of itself was not new; Phule too subordinated academic exactness to constructing a community of resistance). History here was about rearranging events to address present-day contingencies. And so, he would tell the story Hindus needed to hear to enthrone Hindutva and seize power.

---
Savarkar, travelling where his guru Tilak hesitated to go, viewed caste as the greatest practical hurdle to Hindu consolidation. He transformed himself therefore into what those non-Brahmin intellectuals sought: a Brahmin who identified purely as Hindu. Only embracing Hinduness on equal terms with their lower-caste fellows could ‘crush the designs of foreigners’. Where even Brahmins subgroups would not dine together, he organized feasts where all castes ate as one. Between 1930 and 1935, 150 such exhibitions of commensality were staged. In 1929, he established a temple where all castes worshipped together. In actualizing Hinduness, that is, unlike Tilak, his heir was prepared to bulldoze through even fundamental attributes of everyday Hinduism like caste

---
Inevitably talk of Hindu sangathan (union) meant those deemed not Hindu came under attack. And Muslims, the largest (and politically most vocal) minority, were Savarkar’s chief target. Ironically, as late as 1925, in his book on the Marathas, he assured Muslims that in critiquing Islamic rule, he was not railing against them as a community. That would be ‘ridiculous’. But twelve years later, his stance hardened. 1937 also saw him become head of the Hindu Mahasabha—a cultural body founded in 1915.

This consciousness of Hindus—divided into sects and castes—as being a single ‘majority’ was itself a product of colonial censuses, which enumerated Indians and solidified what, earlier, were more vague labels. Coupled with concerns about conversion, which as we saw, had a controversy-ridden history, by the twentieth century, there was fear that Christians and Muslims were drawing away critical human capital, particularly from low-caste segments. Indeed, colonial voices did ask that if Hinduism were formally defined along Brahminical lines, surely those not subscribing to Brahminism belonged elsewhere? Savarkar’s Hindutva and reform efforts were a means to resist this.

In 1936, for example, when the Travancore maharajah granted Dalits temple entry, it was chiefly to prevent conversion and neutralize the missionary threat.

---
The attitude of organizations like the Muslim League, founded in 1906, exacerbated things. Muslims did not possess strength in numbers. So, to hold their own, and maintain a measure of political power, some argued that they constituted a separate nation. India, in other words, housed not one but two peoples. Of course, like with the Hindu identity, this too had contradictions: Malabar’s matrilineal Muslims venerated the Quran, as did Muslims in Bhopal; but in colour, dress, food and language, they were strangers. Cultural distinctions, in fact, made some Muslims look unIslamic even

---
Savarkar, however, refused to allow territorial nationalism, also dismissing Congress’s efforts to brand Hindutva an illegitimate religious supremacism. To Savarkar, nationalism had necessarily to be reinforced with culture. And when it came to this, Muslims had their ‘faces . . . ever turned towards Mecca’; to a Hindu, on the other hand, ‘India is all in all of his National being.’ Only Hindus were committed to the country. Which meant also that their interests were the national interest. In a universe of missionary faiths, he called on Hindus to cultivate missionary qualities—or viewed another way, to become what their enemies were. As his 1909 book observes, if the two communities worked together during the Great Rebellion, it was because Hindus had already broken Islamic power, redressing ‘national shame’. Brotherhood emerged because Muslims no longer ruled India.

But, Savarkar added, Hindus had only themselves to blame. Historically, the ‘Hindu mind’ was too ‘tolerant’.

---
The Congress, he warned, was letting the League blackmail it. As the League began demanding a separate state—Pakistan—his umbrage was magnified. Congress, he declared, instead of taking a tough line with the League, went out to attack the Mahasabha for frightening Muslims. 

For all his eloquence, however, the Mahasabha neither succeeded in building an organizational base, nor in wooing many Hindus. Not least because Congress also, behind a veneer of high-minded impartiality, often acted like a Hindu party, sans the divisive language. Most Hindu interests, then, backed Gandhi’s entity instead of betting on a more extreme party. 

The British had thrown Congress leaders in jail and were scouting for brown allies; Savarkar now became one of these allies. Brandishing ‘responsive cooperation’—an idea Tilak crafted to allow occasional understandings with the colonial government—Savarkar saw a window for the Mahasabha to swell in stature. All forms of justification were arrayed to support this move, which has caused embarrassment since. So too the fascination Savarkar and his supporters felt for Nazi Germany backfired.

---
The British were ejected from the subcontinent. But they left a visible, festering legacy, for the country was divided.

---
On the whole, Savarkar's book reads as frustration with his own times: how Hindus actually behaved in supporting Congress, versus what they should have done—backed him. The problem this father of Hindutva confronted was that while there were Hindus, most were not the type he wished them to be; the kind of people for whom he had (re)written whole histories. 

Sadly, the bulk of them didn’t seem interested: Hindus’ innate diversity stood in the way of crafting one identity, one vision and one purpose.

#### WHAT IS HINDUISM?
##### Chapter Summary: 

##### Highlights 
In June 1889, a man called W.H. Findlay produced a crisp defence of missionary activity in India.

> The task the revivers of Hinduism have set themselves is to make it satisfy new ideals which they have accepted from Christianity. They are not supporting Hinduism as their fathers believed it . . . they are trying to imagine it to be, or to frame out of it, a worthy rival of Christianity . . . So ignorant have Hindus, in general, been in the past, of what their conglomerate religion is, that they can easily persuade themselves that what they now call Hinduism is the old genuine belief of their fathers, which in our descriptions we grossly malign. But this error of theirs is of very secondary importance. Our triumph is that the Hindus who have, at last, begun to value religion, have a high, a Christian ideal of what a religion should be.

It is this acquisition of a new shape, with its tendency to mimic the Christian pattern, that often sparks the argument that modern Hinduism is ‘invented’. While there is no doubt that colonialism and exposure to the West dramatically altered Hinduism—indeed, even gave it its current name—the suggestion that this is ‘invention’, and by extension lacks legitimacy, is somewhat simplistic.

Long before Europeans arrived on the scene, Hindu intellectuals had already started to delineate a separate identity as Hindus. One impetus came from Islamic rule. Historian Muzaffar Alam notes, ‘By the fourteenth century the term Hindu had significantly begun to denote a religious culture to encompass all such cults and traditions as originated and developed within the geographical limits’ of India. European rule, it would appear, only ripened what already existed in a foetal shape, its conception the product of a different set of encounters.

---
Assertion of such unity became necessary only when the context presented itself. After all, Hinduism was never shaped by a book as much as by the currents of history. Hindus, that is, asserted Hinduness as an overarching principle precisely because they confronted an identity separate—and occasionally hostile—to theirs. And it certainly wasn’t as categorically defined or total as Savarkar would suggest.

In specific contexts, religious identity allowed for networks of solidarity, and for political and social mobilization. There was a recognizable Hinduness long in the air; colonial pressures only roused this into fortifying itself a certain way.

---
Identities shift and transform; all of Hinduism’s history, we know, is marked by adaptation. Eventually, some readings gained precedence, and internal coherence was constructed. Yet, just as Rajputs and Brahmins possessed caste identities but also shared a Hinduness, different varieties of Christians also could claim a shared Christianity. And this could be selectively drawn on, in times of nervousness especially.

Where religion is concerned, Europe pictured it as a specific type of box with specific contents. ‘Native’ minds hitherto experienced religion as a network of beliefs, yes; but living under colonial pressures now, many endorsed the box, populating it with chosen strands from their traditions. Hinduism, we might conclude, then, is only ‘invented’ insofar as all religious categories are invented—and reinvented.

---
The appeal for a ‘return to the Vedas’ stemmed here from the political validation it contained. The Vedas’ philosophical segments, after all, enjoyed European (orientalist) approval even as the rest of Hindu culture was lambasted. In a time when colonized Hindus sought self-respect as well as a shield against missionaries, a Veda-oriented presentation of religion served multiple purposes. In the process, though, Hindus themselves denigrated other aspects of their religious system. Yes, the orthodox Brahmin had always looked down on certain traditions—‘inferior’ deities, blood rites and popular religion more generally. However, as the scholar Günther-Dietz Sontheimer wrote, there had in the past been a ‘continuum’ between different ‘currents of religion’. The Brahmin of older ages ‘could not and would not abolish folk religion’, only stamping it as lower in rank. But his modern reformist successor not only viewed these segments of Hinduism with contempt, he also actively railed against it, often in language echoing the missionary.

But Hinduism’s equation with a purely Brahminical reading of it was enabled by another factor too. Even in pre-colonial times, Brahmin presence in administration and courtly spaces was on the ascendant. In Hindu states especially, a template of Brahminized ritual and practice was rising already. This meant that in the modern period, Brahmins were primed to slide into positions of dominance in the public sphere: They were at the forefront of engagements with white men, in the press, literate professions, state offices, political movements, universities and more. In emergent national spaces, their voices acquired a force exceeding their real numbers among Hindus. And naturally, their framing of religion gained potency.

---
The Hindu identity was here positioned not only in contrast to Muslims but also Dalits (‘untouchables’). Indeed, what divided Hindu from non-Hindu was untouchability, not faith, Muslims being cast with ‘polluting’ groups. The historical Hindu, put another way, represented some specific (privileged, dominant) sections of Indian society, not the whole. The ‘modern project of Hindu political monotheism’, however, ‘induct[s] the privileged and the pariah into a universal, congregational plane of Hindu identity’. In fixing who had the strongest claim on the state’s resources—and with the rise of nationalism, on the country itself—value emerged in the idea of asserting ‘majority’.

In this, it creatively borrows missionary strategies. The Arya Samaj, for example, pursued Dalits despite the risk of violence from orthodox Hindus horrified by the idea. Dalits, meanwhile, who accepted their Hinduness were expected to amend several existing practices, particularly those that provoked high-caste disgust or featured Muslim influences. For if there is one thing that endangers the bottle of modern Hindu political assertion, besides the missionary, it is internal, caste-based ‘bickering’. Not everywhere though. In the same period, in Karnataka, the Sringeri Matha—a major Hindu institution—began sponsoring the local Muharram.

---
We speak here primarily of the Chitpavan Brahmins of Maharashtra who rose under the Peshwas. In this they displaced the Deshastha Brahmins—an older elite and rival Brahmin subcaste—and it was Deshasthas who assisted the East India Company. That said, the Brahmins of the Deccan as a whole were suspected not just by the British but older imperial powers also.

The preference for the Brahminical can, of course, be explained partly by Brahmin dominance in the spheres of reform, administration, nationalism and in those in dialogue with the colonial state. But additionally, in a diverse country like India, historically also—as we saw in the Introduction—the Brahminical offered unifying elements. This served Hindu intellectuals well in the intersection between religion, nationalism and the assertion of pan-Indian identity.
