### Sebastian And Sons: A Brief History Of The Mrdangam Makers (T. M. Krishna)

- The home of the holy trinity—Thyagaraja, Muthusvami Dikshitar and Syama Sastri—Thanjavur has an unbroken tradition of Karnatik music, Harikatha, Namasankirtana and Bharatanatyam (or Sadir, as it was in its earlier form practised by the devadasis). In 1676, Ekoji became the first Maratha ruler of Thanjavur. Along with the change in governance came the Maharashtrian cultural influx. The Naradiya tradition of Harikatha became a mainstay in the brahmin quarters of Thanjavur and its surrounding areas. At these presentations, mrdangam artists of Maratha origin used to accompany the kirtankar.

- A deliberate ‘forgetfulness’ about the older style is caused by the fact that, by the mid-twentieth century, the Maratha-influenced Thanjavur tradition became the brahmin style, while the tavil- and Sadir-inspired Pudukkottai tradition became associated with the isai vellalar aesthetic. In those older times, of course, it was unthinkable for brahmins to be playing this skin instrument. The mrdangam was played by the isai vellalar community—consisting of nadasvaram and tavil artists, male conductors of Sadir performances and devadasis—or Maratha non-brahmin musicians.

- The uncomfortable truth that this paternalistic feudalism was a form of validation for the makers must not be brushed under the carpet. Being needed and valued by someone in a position of social power, and the dissolving of physical barriers and the stigma of caste, gave the maker a sense of equality. The mrdangam player was in desperate need of someone to fulfil a certain need, a job they could not imagine doing themselves. When social changes exerted pressure on the existing ways of doing things, something had to give. Possibly, this also created a need for artists to present themselves as forward-thinking.

- This entire celebration of the past and present, which is couched in belonging, comes from caste privilege. The privileged find ways of recording memories—through narrations, paintings, vessels, heirlooms, rituals, clothes and recipes. And within these carriers are transferred character sketches, jokes, smiles, disagreements and celebrations. The negative characters in our families too are given a role; their actions condemned, trivialised or jocularly set aside. But for an individual from a marginalised caste, history is a burden of emotional, intellectual, aesthetic and economic denial and deprivation. Memory decides that forgetting is its job in the hope that the scars might disappear and explanations become unnecessary. Father and grandfather are remembered by name and function alone. Villages are not remembered, timelines erased and, often, names are blurred or altered. Even that which is recalled is not alive; it is just an event, something that happened. In a sense, this also defines how their present is viewed by society at large. These are people who have been barred from the memory of culture and society, looked at as tools, their entire intellectual and emotional being reduced to the service they provide. They too are socialised to believe in this contract.

- For the older generation of makers from Thanjavur—who made the transition to Madras, and for whom the umbilical cord of the work is the personal relationship with the artist—change has been difficult to digest. They recognise that there is a measure of caste-based discrimination, yet miss something of the old feudal set-up, perhaps the strange intimacy of it. These makers seem to differentiate between the previous generation and themselves, and believe that their own relationships with artists evolved into a different connection. In the current relationship between the maker and the artist, they perceive a distancing: mere functionality, a job sans the personal touch. They position themselves as the mean between the ugly distant past and utilitarian present, and this is beautifully explained in something a maker said to me, ‘Those days they kept us away and discriminated; today they keep us close and discriminate.’ Their past and their present encapsulated in one line.

  Their work has become contractual; therefore, the labourer–employer structure is more starkly visible. For him, the older model smothered this reality. When the maker had access to the player’s personal spaces and life, and worked within that domain, there was the delusionary comfort of a personal bond that both masked the labour involved and allowed them to make excuses for casteist behaviour. Even if the artist does not help, the lady of the house would do something for them, they say. Makers saw this as closeness, an atmosphere of working together, a fusing of sorts.

  Another analogy further explains the problem with this notion. ‘The relationship between the vidvan (an honorific often used for seasoned artists) and the worker is like that of a husband and wife. Only if there are arguments and disagreements between the husband and the wife will the family move ahead. In the mix is also the knowledge that, if they are ostracised, they can survive, either by pulling a rickshaw or daily labour. As a maker said, ‘I am ready to do the lowest work. But the mrdangam artist cannot—he will have to answer societal questions.’ Implicit in this assertion about being willing to do the lowest of jobs is the claim of a higher status for his current work that caters to the brahmin’s art world.

- There is also the knowledge that the player is dependent on the maker. It lends a certain charge to their uneven relationship: the players have no choice, they cannot work with skin. There is a kind of helplessness associated with the artist’s need, one that may even be internalised as power by the makers. The profession is then seen as a form of emancipation, which in turn keeps the makers deferential and compliant in a subordinate relationship.

- The unfortunate truth is that none of the older mrdangam players I interviewed spoke of affection, though there is an occasional reference to a maker as an almost-son. To them, the makers were always ‘workers’ even when they said ‘he was like my son’. Right through my interviews, the term used to describe them was ‘worker’ or ‘labourer’—not ‘maker’. The other word artists used was ‘repairer’. There was no exception, absolutely none. The instrument is made by the maker in its entirety, and later he helps in its maintenance, but he is never credited with the creation itself.

  What happens when you label something as labour? It is characterised as a mechanical operation that lacks intellectual value or creative energies. The individuals engaged in that act are also reduced to just bodies and their work to supply. Social hierarchies like caste allow divisions to flourish with impunity, so everyone, even the oppressed, buys into it.

- I wanted to understand how makers of earlier generations viewed discrimination. What I discovered was that, coming from the dalit community that had a rare direct link with brahmins because of an artistic necessity, they perceived discrimination only in terms of untouchability. In other words, the sharing of space, air, time, food and art was seen as castelessness.

- A different manifestation of caste seems to be at work now. Paul speaks of how mrdangam artists are putting out videos on social media about the making of the instrument, thereby implying that they are doing and can do all the work involved, which is of course untrue. By claiming knowledge of workmanship, artists are now infringing upon the maker’s area of expertise, and the latter see it (quite rightly) as coming from a sense of caste and class superiority.

- Several makers also pointed out that mrdangam artists were unwilling to teach them. Today, some people show willingness, but it is too late for the makers I interviewed. Artists expect that the sons of the makers will carry on the profession. When a mrdangam maker approached an artist for a job reference, the artist responded with an assurance to help him rise as a maker. When another argued over retirement benefits, the artist assured him that he would employ the maker’s son too. The sons of these musicians are these days employed in the information technology industry, as chartered accountants or in the management sector in India or the US. Yet, the players expect the sons of makers to be mrdangam makers. One

- Mrdangam artist Kalidas made a keen observation. He said that people from other communities entering the field of mrdangam-making is a very recent phenomenon. Need, he believed, drives them to these opportunities, but they are all exceptions to the rule. He was right; the presence of makers from non-dalit castes is still a rarity. The process of making a tavil is divided among many people. Nevertheless, it appears that the procurement and initial work with the hide still remained with the dalit community. As we move down the pecking order of caste, the occupational divide between the artist and the maker shrinks. So, those occupying the lowest rungs play a dual role: a dalit or tribal percussion artist is also the maker of the instrument he plays.

- When it came to isai vellalar musicians, brahmin protectionism kicked in. when an isai vellalar became a maker, there was greater comfort in the interaction. They were not competing for the same space as the brahmin mrdangam artist, but offering a service from a lower rank. Secondly, now the players did not need to associate only with the dalits for their mrdangam work.

- The jacktree's wood is the holy grail of mrdangams. There is a stage before we even get to the leather—and that is selecting and seasoning the wood that forms the shell of the instrument. This is what the asaris traditionally do. The asaris are members of the vishwakarma community. Categorised as OBC (other backward castes) by the government of India, they occupy the lower rungs of the caste order.




Once designers of great temples and monuments, they are now invisible.
