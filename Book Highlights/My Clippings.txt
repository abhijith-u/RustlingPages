Much like the techniques of mrdangam-making, the art of creating wooden shells was refined only in the early part of the twentieth century, at least as far as we can tell. With the Thanjavur makers, we are able to trace a history stretching back to the early twentieth century, but very little is known about the woodcrafters’ work culture in the past.

Irrespective of whether they were from Thanjavur, Chennai, Peruvemba, Bangalore or someplace in Andhra Pradesh, the mrdangam makers took pride in their work, and were always ready to explain its technical and artistic niceties and nuances. The story with the woodcrafters was very different. They have no direct engagement with the actual sound that emanates from the mrdangam. The shell leaves their workshop, never to return, and they do not hear an artist test the instrument or even go to a concert.

the wood. It was no longer only a resonating chamber, but an entity that was capable of coming alive with sound, and with colour, rings and various marks on its body. Thinking of kattais in this manner shifts our engagement as a listener.

The two apertures of the hollow kattai are covered with membranes made of animal hide. The dominant end has a smaller aperture, and this is what faces the audience in a typical performance. This is called the valandalai, the right-side head. The larger aperture on the other side has a characteristic bass tone and is called the toppi,

When non-dalit makers speak of the Thanjavur family, they accuse them of using substandard material or lying to artists about its source (e.g. they use skin bought in Chennai but inform their clients that it was directly sourced from Thanjavur). At some point, almost everyone makes some ‘adjustments’ in their work, so it is not entirely unlikely that some of them do this. What matters here is not the truth or untruth of these accusations, but the fact that they are made only against makers of certain castes.

A careful listening to some of the older artists—predating the Mani Iyers and Palanis—gives us a glimpse into the role and intentionality of the mrdangam artist. There was a time when its rhythm was interwoven with the melody of the voice and the violin or vina. Its role was subdued and had a flowing gait to it. This changed dramatically with the Mani Iyer–Palani generation. There was a greater frontal display of individuality, an emphasis on the rhythmic aspects of every composition and of the mrdangam artist’s own presence on stage. Listen to any recording of Mani Iyer or Palani, and you are immediately struck by their obvious boldness. The mrdangam artist’s search for a more aggressive musical expression drove many of the instrument’s physical and aesthetic changes. It was an exploration driven by the artists’ desire for attention and for a greater focus on the mrdangam artist during a concert. This required structural changes to the form, presentation and appearance of the performative act. All of which have entirely succeeded in changing the music and position of the mrdangam.

To my mind, at least part of this need for a larger mrdangam was driven by male testosterone. The early mrdangam was barely more than the seated width of the artist himself. Now it was heavy and solid—burly, you could say.

The maker stands at the threshold, keeping the cow and the brahmin apart, helping the latter maintain his ‘purity’. So, the maker is vital for the player, yet his role also keeps the maker ‘polluted’ and unequal.

The valandalai is the predominant, assertive side of the instrument. The toppi lends support, much like the dagga for the tabla. It is the valandalai that is tuned to the tonic of the singer or instrumentalist whom the mrdangam artist is accompanying, or, in the case of a mrdangam solo, to a specific tonic of the mrdangam artist’s own choosing.

This right head of the mrdangam has three layers of skin, each with a different utility. The bottom-most one is usually cow skin and is known as the okkarara thattu, which means ‘that which it sits on’. This layer sits on the wood, and the two musically functional thattus sit on it. The role of the okkarara thattu is to be a cushion between the wooden frame and the other thattus; it has no tonal role.

The makers call it sama thattu, meaning its gauge is equal all over. For the valandalai, the thattu has to be sama thattu, because any variation in gauge will affect the tuning of it to a designated pitch.

This last cow skin layer, right on top, is called the vettu thattu. Vettu means ‘to cut’, and that is exactly what is done: it is an annular layer. A circle is cut in the centre of this thattu in such a manner that the kottu thattu below is exposed.

Being in the business of skin is not easy. Everything goes against the makers: their caste, economic standing and social location. People do not like that their area is being downgraded because of the skin and leather strewn around. Complaining about the dirtiness of the work indirectly and derogatorily points at the makers’ caste. Sowriar’s wife, Sarada, told me that most brahmin mrdangam artists from Mylapore have no issues with their presence. It is the non-brahmin Hindu middle class that gives them a hard time. This could also be because the makers’ homes and shops are usually cheek-by-jowl with the properties owned by people belonging to socially mid-level non-brahmin castes. They share small square feet areas with the makers, and are uncomfortable with the scent of freshly peeled skin. If the makers are shunted out, these complainers have nothing to lose. For the mrdangam artists, though, the makers are indispensable and their proximity is a necessary condition.

There is a fairly prominent, black, round area on the mrdangam’s playing surface, which faces the audience. This black patch is on the kottu thattu, the goat-skin second layer, and is made of a paste that contains finely powdered kittankallu and cooked rice.

This paste of cooked rice and kittankallu is crucial to the sound of the mrdangam. The sadam acts as a load (an added weight) on the membrane. It is this load that provides the valandalai its harmonics. Without it, the mrdangam cannot be tuned to the desired tonics.

This requires multitasking, checking three kinds of tuning. One, bringing down the pitch of the valandalai with every layer of sadam, and two, ensuring that the pitch at all the kannus are aligned so that there is no ecchu–taggu. At the same time, the sound emanating from the vettu thattu and that which comes from the kottu thattu must also be in tune. Constantly checking, the maker alters the way he applies the sadam depending on all these factors: closer circles, wider circles, maybe even closer to a specific kannu, hitting on the pinnal from below or above and fiddling with the varu tightness. This is a complex tuning methodology.

the final shape of the sadam is idli-like, concave and thinning towards the edges of the kottu thattu. That is, there is more sadam at the centre when compared to the edge. The concavity varies from maker to maker, and depends on the tonic to which the mrdangam is being tuned.

According to the Thanjavur makers, the kittankallu is irreplaceable in the preparation of sadam. But makers in Madras, Peruvemba and Andhra use stones found in their own localities. Madras makers get their stones from Red Hills, Manimangalam or Maraimalai Nagar.

Every one of these stones was high in iron content, but it was the sample from Tada that had the highest percentage of iron (ferrous), 73.2 per cent—much more than the much-touted kittankallu, which contained 53.4 per cent iron (ferrous and some ferric). Other than the Tada stone, all the other samples also revealed the presence of quartz.

Each stone, and the sadam derived from it, gives the mrdangam a distinct aesthetic presence. There cannot be ‘only one’. Needless to say, the Thanjavur makers will swear that theirs is the best.

caste. It is an intellectual, emotional, psychological and physical assertion of power. In this case, a community that considers its own abilities as being beyond the physical, derives power from instructing another to do the corporeal work. Bundled in this is an underlying feeling among the artist community that their work is above all these temporal activities. However, they are able to control and push people who are physically better endowed. That their elevated virtuosity depends on material effort is explained away as a willing contribution by the makers—imagine, these people (makers) are able to associate with the likes of Mani Iyer or Palani. Perhaps many players have not consciously thought in this manner, but it would still be a pretence not to acknowledge the inner workings of the player–maker equation.

Rajesh also spoke about how mrdangam makers are recruited at the government music colleges in Thiruvananthapuram, Thripunithura and Palakkad. Many who apply have no background in making. Since the examiners (typically, mrdangam artists) know very little about the making process, the selection is unfair and haphazard. While he was also making the point that preferential selections are made, Rajesh’s statement revealed that no senior mrdangam maker is ever an examiner, only mrdangam players. An appalling and painful state of affairs.

two tenuously connected worlds: the upper-caste performance and learning environment on the one end and the marginalised mrdangam maker on the other. They overlap only for convenience, and remain socially and aesthetically disengaged. This separation conveniently reinforces the brahminical lie that caste is varna (occupation- or ability-based social hierarchy) and not jati (birth-based social hierarchy). And this results in cultural ‘othering’.
