Socialism . . . Seriously: A Brief Guide to Human Liberation
Danny Katch

The whole civilization-as-jungle thing is a bizarre concept. Why did we spend the last ten thousand years discovering fire, painting on cave walls, developing writing, building Rome and Timbuktu, and creating philosophy and astronomy if the whole point was to eventually figure out how to live like we were back in the wild?

*****

Ever since the theory of evolution was laid out by Charles Darwin, it has been distorted into an illogical justification of capitalism known as “Social Darwinism.”

*****

Socialists are big fans of Darwin

*****

because it is a wonderful illustration of dialectics, a philosophical approach based on change and contradiction. Dialectics stresses that things are both what they appear to be and a mess of conflicts underneath the surface that might eventually turn them into something else, sometimes over millennia and sometimes in an instant.

Capitalism emerged—slowly in some places, explosively in others—in parts of Europe from the 1300s to the 1700s. It came into being within the confines of feudal societies, which in their best-known form were dominated by large landowners who used peasants to grow food and knights to fight with other landowners. The internal conflict inside feudalism that eventually produced capitalism was between these landowners and a growing class of merchants who generated wealth through trade and investment. Merchants had been around for thousands of years, but these ones happened to live in a historical moment when Europe’s conquest of the Americas and enslavement of Africans created unprecedented opportunities for wealth and power for those who weren’t born into landowning families.

capitalism exists today not because it is the best of all possible economic systems but because history happened to work out in a certain way—which included some of the greatest crimes in human histor

Agriculture, private property, and inheritance led to a fourth development that Friedrich Engels called “a world historic defeat for the female sex.” Having many children is more useful in an agricultural society where they can be extra hands in the fields than it is in a hunter-gatherer society where they are mostly extra mouths to feed. Thus, women’s lives became primarily about having and raising children, which removed them from the status of being breadwinners (bread-growers, really) in the fields. On top of that, the tradition of inheritance increased the importance of being able to determine who was the father of each child. This led to women’s sexual monogamy being strictly enforced in a way it didn’t have to be for men, since it’s usually pretty obvious who the mother is at childbirth.3

*****

Capitalism is by far the most productive and innovative class society because it is based not on land but on capital that can be reinvested, and on competition between capitalists, which forces them to take most of the capital created by their workers and invest it back into developing new methods of creating even more capital. This is why technology has developed much more in one capitalist decade than it did for entire centuries before the 1800s.5It’s also why the European and North American countries that developed capitalism first gained an enormous advantage that enabled them to drag the rest of the world into their new system on quite unfavorable terms.

*****

Capitalism has achieved amazing things, some of which are appreciated most of all by socialists, who aren’t blinded by the Social Darwinist propaganda that this is humanity’s natural state.

*****

The problem is that while capitalism produces so much surplus that for the first time in history there is enough for every single person to live and live well, it still requires—as previous class societies did—that surplus to be controlled and guarded by a small minority, so that the rest of us have to go to work for them and create more capital. In other words, capitalism has created a world in which capitalists should now be obsolete.

*****

It’s time to take charge of our own evolution and have the majority who create society’s wealth control how it is distributed. We now have the ability to combine the egalitarianism and democracy of preclass societies with the material abundance and technological capability of twenty-first-century capitalism.

today. At the time Britain was still mostly ruled by the aristocratic landowning class, with its rigid feudal hierarchies

*****

In this context,The Wealth of Nationswas a radical argument that the capitalist class had discovered a better way for society to be run.
This way was built upon three basic elements: self-interest, competition, and accumulation. Together these formed a potent synthesis: the first drives innovation, the second spreads the benefits of innovation across society, and the third produces more innovation.

*****

All of this activity takes place in what Smith called the free market,

*****

They key word for Smith wasfree, meaning that these are voluntary transactions, unlike the obligatory relationships in previous societies between lords and peasants or slaves and slave owners.

*****

. It also coordinates and regulates the exchange between capital and labor. In other words, the free market, with its mechanism of supply and demand, sets the rate at which workers are compensated.

*****

Tyranny: Exploitation and Oppression

*****

Most participants in the “free market” are actually not at all free.

*****

the decision to work for someone else—to sell our labor on the market—is only a voluntary or “free decision” for rich people who don’t have to work in order to survive.

*****

The irony of the free market concept is that capitalism would cease to function if most people had the true freedom of economic security.

*****

This relationship between those who are forced to sell their labor and those who have the capital to use it to make a profit is what socialists call exploitation. All profits are based on exploitation,

*****

When the question of profits is addressed in mainstream economics, it’s not to figure out where they came from but to justify why they should go to bosses who often did little to earn them. Thus, many economists claim that profits are a reward given to capitalists for the risk of investing in a business.

*****

Defenders of capitalism reach for these and other outlandish theories because it’s awkward to acknowledge that the real source of profit is the workers who don’t see any of it.

*****

In order to avoid getting overthrown by a mob of unvanquishable lions, much less keep us at our jobs every day making their profits, capitalists need ways to keep us in our place. This is where oppression comes in. Oppression refers to the systemic mistreatment of some group of people on the basis of their ethnicity, gender, disability, sexual identity, or some other factor. It both weakens specific groups of people and keeps them divided from others with whom they could potentially unite.

*****

Note the word systemic—as in something rooted in societal institutions, not unpleasant individual interactions.

*****

It’s about some people getting worse educations, job and housing opportunities, and health care than others, and being made to feel through advertising, schools, and interactions with police and other authorities that they are second-class citizens.

*****

Exploitation and oppression are partners. It’s impossible to imagine the exploitation of African Americans through slavery and sharecropping without the racism that held them to be subhuman, just as there is no way that women could be paid less than their male counterparts without a sexist framework that they should be expected to prioritize family over work.

*****

But oppression is also an entirely separate thing from exploitation, with very different characteristics. Not only that, but each form of oppression has its own unique features and history that have to be understood on their own. T

*****

Exploitation remains a constant fact of life, but oppressions can rise and fall in intensity.

*****

the much-hyped freedoms of capitalism are mostly limited to a tiny minority that has the resources to make truly free choices. Emperors and slave-owners from centuries past would not be totally unfamiliar with this variety of freedom.

*****

Anarchy: Competition and Crisis

*****

But despite the hopes of many environmentalists, capitalism is doing almost nothing to address global warming even as it has started to hit close to the most expensive homes.

*****

There’s plenty of talk about stopping climate change coming from corporate and government leaders

*****

The problem is that as powerful as they are compared with us, they are not the true masters of society. Capitalism is run not by capitalists but by capital itself.

*****

Capitalists are driven by the fear that if they don’t increase profits, someone else will who could eventually put them out of business.

*****

A society that rewards selfishness and punishes sharing does not work very well even for some of those at the top of the capitalist food chain—and it’s a disaster for the rest of us. Far from being a reflection of human nature, pure individualism is violently alien to the human experience. We have always depended upon one another, as well as other species, for survival and happiness.

*****

overproduction is just what inevitably occurs in any profitable industry, not because individual capitalists can’t control themselves but because they can’t control their competition

*****

Engels wrote that capitalism combines the tyranny of each boss over his workers with the anarchy of all the bosses’ blind competition with one another on the market.

*****

Capitalism imposes the alien values of capital on human beings. Education is transformed from the ability to think for ourselves about the world around us into test results measuring the basic literacy and ability to sit still necessary to be good future employees. Neighborhoods are no longer communities who look after one another but blocks of property values that are meant to relentlessly rise even if that gentrification will force many of the people we’ve known for years to have to leave.

*****

What Adam Smith brilliantly understood was that capitalism created a world of freedom. The part he got wrong was that the citizens of this world would not be people but capital,

*****

In the national mythology, one small segment of society is The Rich and a slightly larger one is The Poor.

*****

By default, everybody else is in the middle, which is useless for understanding class but great for disguising it. If everyone is middle class, then millions of daily episodes of class conflict—between managers and managed, landlords and land-lorded, and so on—become just so many random personality beefs.

*****

Class isn’t just about wealth.
Throughout history, classes have been defined more by what they do than by how much they make

more clickable.”
Classes are categories based on the roles different groups of people play in the ongoing production and reproduction of their society’s needs and wants. Capitalist society has three main classes:
• Capitalists, who own what Marx calls “the means of production,” meaning the wealth that they use to invest in land and tools in order to create more wealth (that is, profits).
• Workers, whose labor the capitalists have to buy because land and tools can’t turn themselves into profits.
• A middle class of managers, professionals, and small business owners, whose work combines aspects of both capitalists and workers.
These classes are not defined by income.

*****

The point of dividing society into these classes is not to neatly assign everyone to their proper category, which is impossible since class lines blur across boundaries.

*****

Each class can only be defined in terms of tension-filled relationships to the others. Without owners, there are no workers. Without workers, no supervisors.
