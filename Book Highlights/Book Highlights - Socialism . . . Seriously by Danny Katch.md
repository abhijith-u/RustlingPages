### Socialism . . . Seriously: A Brief Guide to Human Liberation by Danny Katch

#### 1. Introduction
　
- Socialism is a society whose top priority is meeting all of its people’s needs—ranging from food, shelter, and health care to art, culture, and companionship. In contrast, capitalism only cares about any of that basic human necessity stuff to the extent that money can be made off it.

- It is certainly true that neither the “communist” dictators of Russia and China nor the mild “socialist” reformers in Sweden and France succeeded in creating the liberated democratic societies that Marx and Engels described in the Manifesto. We are haunted—whether we know it or not—not only by the future horrors of capitalism but by the past failures of socialism.

- Two simple but far-reaching concepts about socialism:
  1. Working people control the government.
  2. The government controls the economy.
  Number 2 has been the main feature of countries that call themselves socialist or communist, but without Number 1—without democracy at every level of society—state control of the economy has nothing to do with socialism

- Socialists first got a glimpse of this in the 1871 revolution known as the Paris Commune, which created a new form of government in which officials were paid no more than the average worker’s wage and were immediately recallable if voters were unhappy with them. Radical participatory democracy is the heart of the socialist vision.

- Before it lost its socialist character and became a dictatorship, the Russian Revolution was led by democratically elected soviets. These local bodies sprang up in factories, military barracks, and peasant villages across the country to conduct the revolution in their local areas and elect delegates to the regional and national soviet government.

- As with the Paris Commune, delegates to the soviet could be voted out immediately by unhappy voters. Housewives, domestic servants, and other working people who didn’t labor in factories could organize themselves into bodies and gain representation in the soviets. Only employers and police were excluded

- But there is also some truth to conservative fears that all social welfare programs carry within them the dangerous germ of socialism. Not because socialism is about government control but because these programs are evidence that capitalism cannot meet some of society’s most basic needs. Liberalism can agree with socialism that some things about capitalism should be reformed, and socialists often work alongside liberals to win those changes. Where we differ is that liberalism views reforms as ways to preserve capitalism while socialism sees them as steps toward replacing it

- “Communism” and “socialism” used to mean the same thing in most contexts for Marx and that’s how I treat them in this book.

#### 2. Dig Deeper
　
- Inequality had been growing for decades—from 1979 the richest one-tenth of the One Percent saw their incomes quadruple while the number of people in poverty grew by fifty million. But that was a slow, mysterious process. In 2008 people saw the same thing happen within a few months, and it was obviously the result of a system that was stacked against us.

- If you are “too big to fail,” you can get away with literally anything. Consider the case of HSBC bank, which was caught laundering billions of dollars for Mexican drug cartels and groups linked to al-Qaeda. And yet because HSBC was considered too big to fail (or jail), it got off with no criminal charges. The bald-faced immorality goes far beyond bailouts. Because corporations have enough money to buy off politicians with what to them is just pocket change, most of them pay lower tax rates than someone making a salary of $40,000 a year.

- Capitalism is being widely questioned today because the past few years have shown that what is good for this thing called “the economy”—usually defined by stock prices and growth rates—doesn’t have much to do with what is good for most of us.

- The whole civilization-as-jungle thing is a bizarre concept. Why did we spend the last ten thousand years discovering fire, painting on cave walls, developing writing, building Rome and Timbuktu, and creating philosophy and astronomy if the whole point was to eventually figure out how to live like we were back in the wild?

*****

Ever since the theory of evolution was laid out by Charles Darwin, it has been distorted into an illogical justification of capitalism known as “Social Darwinism.”

*****

Socialists are big fans of Darwin

*****

because it is a wonderful illustration of dialectics, a philosophical approach based on change and contradiction. Dialectics stresses that things are both what they appear to be and a mess of conflicts underneath the surface that might eventually turn them into something else, sometimes over millennia and sometimes in an instant.

*****

Capitalism emerged—slowly in some places, explosively in others—in parts of Europe from the 1300s to the 1700s. It came into being within the confines of feudal societies, which in their best-known form were dominated by large landowners who used peasants to grow food and knights to fight with other landowners. The internal conflict inside feudalism that eventually produced capitalism was between these landowners and a growing class of merchants who generated wealth through trade and investment. Merchants had been around for thousands of years, but these ones happened to live in a historical moment when Europe’s conquest of the Americas and enslavement of Africans created unprecedented opportunities for wealth and power for those who weren’t born into landowning families.

*****

capitalism exists today not because it is the best of all possible economic systems but because history happened to work out in a certain way—which included some of the greatest crimes in human histor

*****

Agriculture, private property, and inheritance led to a fourth development that Friedrich Engels called “a world historic defeat for the female sex.” Having many children is more useful in an agricultural society where they can be extra hands in the fields than it is in a hunter-gatherer society where they are mostly extra mouths to feed. Thus, women’s lives became primarily about having and raising children, which removed them from the status of being breadwinners (bread-growers, really) in the fields. On top of that, the tradition of inheritance increased the importance of being able to determine who was the father of each child. This led to women’s sexual monogamy being strictly enforced in a way it didn’t have to be for men, since it’s usually pretty obvious who the mother is at childbirth.3

*****

Capitalism is by far the most productive and innovative class society because it is based not on land but on capital that can be reinvested, and on competition between capitalists, which forces them to take most of the capital created by their workers and invest it back into developing new methods of creating even more capital. This is why technology has developed much more in one capitalist decade than it did for entire centuries before the 1800s.5It’s also why the European and North American countries that developed capitalism first gained an enormous advantage that enabled them to drag the rest of the world into their new system on quite unfavorable terms.

*****

Capitalism has achieved amazing things, some of which are appreciated most of all by socialists, who aren’t blinded by the Social Darwinist propaganda that this is humanity’s natural state.

*****

The problem is that while capitalism produces so much surplus that for the first time in history there is enough for every single person to live and live well, it still requires—as previous class societies did—that surplus to be controlled and guarded by a small minority, so that the rest of us have to go to work for them and create more capital. In other words, capitalism has created a world in which capitalists should now be obsolete.

*****

It’s time to take charge of our own evolution and have the majority who create society’s wealth control how it is distributed. We now have the ability to combine the egalitarianism and democracy of preclass societies with the material abundance and technological capability of twenty-first-century capitalism.

*****

today. At the time Britain was still mostly ruled by the aristocratic landowning class, with its rigid feudal hierarchies

*****

In this context,The Wealth of Nationswas a radical argument that the capitalist class had discovered a better way for society to be run.
This way was built upon three basic elements: self-interest, competition, and accumulation. Together these formed a potent synthesis: the first drives innovation, the second spreads the benefits of innovation across society, and the third produces more innovation.

*****

All of this activity takes place in what Smith called the free market,

*****

They key word for Smith wasfree, meaning that these are voluntary transactions, unlike the obligatory relationships in previous societies between lords and peasants or slaves and slave owners.

*****

. It also coordinates and regulates the exchange between capital and labor. In other words, the free market, with its mechanism of supply and demand, sets the rate at which workers are compensated.

*****

Tyranny: Exploitation and Oppression

*****

Most participants in the “free market” are actually not at all free.

*****

the decision to work for someone else—to sell our labor on the market—is only a voluntary or “free decision” for rich people who don’t have to work in order to survive.

*****

The irony of the free market concept is that capitalism would cease to function if most people had the true freedom of economic security.

*****

This relationship between those who are forced to sell their labor and those who have the capital to use it to make a profit is what socialists call exploitation. All profits are based on exploitation,

*****

When the question of profits is addressed in mainstream economics, it’s not to figure out where they came from but to justify why they should go to bosses who often did little to earn them. Thus, many economists claim that profits are a reward given to capitalists for the risk of investing in a business.

*****

Defenders of capitalism reach for these and other outlandish theories because it’s awkward to acknowledge that the real source of profit is the workers who don’t see any of it.

*****

In order to avoid getting overthrown by a mob of unvanquishable lions, much less keep us at our jobs every day making their profits, capitalists need ways to keep us in our place. This is where oppression comes in. Oppression refers to the systemic mistreatment of some group of people on the basis of their ethnicity, gender, disability, sexual identity, or some other factor. It both weakens specific groups of people and keeps them divided from others with whom they could potentially unite.

*****

Note the word systemic—as in something rooted in societal institutions, not unpleasant individual interactions.

*****

It’s about some people getting worse educations, job and housing opportunities, and health care than others, and being made to feel through advertising, schools, and interactions with police and other authorities that they are second-class citizens.

*****

Exploitation and oppression are partners. It’s impossible to imagine the exploitation of African Americans through slavery and sharecropping without the racism that held them to be subhuman, just as there is no way that women could be paid less than their male counterparts without a sexist framework that they should be expected to prioritize family over work.

*****

But oppression is also an entirely separate thing from exploitation, with very different characteristics. Not only that, but each form of oppression has its own unique features and history that have to be understood on their own. T

*****

Exploitation remains a constant fact of life, but oppressions can rise and fall in intensity.

*****

the much-hyped freedoms of capitalism are mostly limited to a tiny minority that has the resources to make truly free choices. Emperors and slave-owners from centuries past would not be totally unfamiliar with this variety of freedom.

*****

Anarchy: Competition and Crisis

*****

But despite the hopes of many environmentalists, capitalism is doing almost nothing to address global warming even as it has started to hit close to the most expensive homes.

*****

There’s plenty of talk about stopping climate change coming from corporate and government leaders

*****

The problem is that as powerful as they are compared with us, they are not the true masters of society. Capitalism is run not by capitalists but by capital itself.

*****

Capitalists are driven by the fear that if they don’t increase profits, someone else will who could eventually put them out of business.

*****

A society that rewards selfishness and punishes sharing does not work very well even for some of those at the top of the capitalist food chain—and it’s a disaster for the rest of us. Far from being a reflection of human nature, pure individualism is violently alien to the human experience. We have always depended upon one another, as well as other species, for survival and happiness.

*****

overproduction is just what inevitably occurs in any profitable industry, not because individual capitalists can’t control themselves but because they can’t control their competition

*****

Engels wrote that capitalism combines the tyranny of each boss over his workers with the anarchy of all the bosses’ blind competition with one another on the market.

*****

Capitalism imposes the alien values of capital on human beings. Education is transformed from the ability to think for ourselves about the world around us into test results measuring the basic literacy and ability to sit still necessary to be good future employees. Neighborhoods are no longer communities who look after one another but blocks of property values that are meant to relentlessly rise even if that gentrification will force many of the people we’ve known for years to have to leave.

*****

What Adam Smith brilliantly understood was that capitalism created a world of freedom. The part he got wrong was that the citizens of this world would not be people but capital,

*****

In the national mythology, one small segment of society is The Rich and a slightly larger one is The Poor.

*****

By default, everybody else is in the middle, which is useless for understanding class but great for disguising it. If everyone is middle class, then millions of daily episodes of class conflict—between managers and managed, landlords and land-lorded, and so on—become just so many random personality beefs.

*****

Class isn’t just about wealth.
Throughout history, classes have been defined more by what they do than by how much they make

*****

more clickable.”
Classes are categories based on the roles different groups of people play in the ongoing production and reproduction of their society’s needs and wants. Capitalist society has three main classes:
• Capitalists, who own what Marx calls “the means of production,” meaning the wealth that they use to invest in land and tools in order to create more wealth (that is, profits).
• Workers, whose labor the capitalists have to buy because land and tools can’t turn themselves into profits.
• A middle class of managers, professionals, and small business owners, whose work combines aspects of both capitalists and workers.
These classes are not defined by income.

*****

The point of dividing society into these classes is not to neatly assign everyone to their proper category, which is impossible since class lines blur across boundaries.

*****

Each class can only be defined in terms of tension-filled relationships to the others. Without owners, there are no workers. Without workers, no supervisors.

#### 5. Who’s in Charge?
　

All types of political systems have shacked up with capitalism, from parliamentary democracies to military dictatorships


　

Full democracy is impossible under an economic system that depends on our lack of freedom.



A system like this simply cannot allow the majority of people to vote on whether or not this setup should be changed


　

Would there be a series of public forums in every community debating the NSA’s powers or private negotiations between the military-industrial complex and tech company executives? The answer to that question tells us who makes the real decisions under capitalism.


　

It is impossible to have a society with vast economic inequality that does not also have vast political inequality. Here’s another way to put it: you can have billionaires or you can have democracy, but you cannot have a lot of both


　

vast discrepancies in wealth lead to vast discrepancies in power—over all of us

　

Economic inequality inevitably leads to political inequality, and just as the rich have been gaining political power, we have been losing it. We aren’t just poorer; we’re weaker and less organized. We work longer hours, pay more for health care, scramble to deal with more precarious childcare arrangements. We face more repression from law enforcement when we try to protest—or, if we are immigrants, Muslims, or African Americans, even when we don’t


　

Every state hides its unaccountable authority over us by claiming to be so connected to us that accountability is unnecessary. There is supposed to be no difference between us and our government.



In truth the first role of states has always been to see, think, and act for the ruling classes of their time, be they slave owners, feudal aristocrats, or transnational corporations

　

Marx and Engels wrote in The Communist Manifesto that the role of capitalist states was to be “a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.” This is a vital function because capitalists are too blinded by competition in pursuit of immediate profits to engage in long-term planning.


　

Capitalists need the state not just to babysit them but to create the basic conditions that make profitable investment possible.

　

Conservatives are usually the ones arguing for “small government,” and yet they are huge fans of the vast armed wings of the state that make up by far the biggest aspect of government bureaucracy: the military, police, border patrol, and spy agencies. These are the state’s core functions, the repressive apparatus at the heart of every society where some have and others don’t.






Socialism . . . Seriously: A Brief Guide to Human Liberation
Danny Katch

Capitalists make up the most powerful class, of course. They have insider access to all levels

*****

When people mention the working class these days, they often simply mean people who don’t have much money. Socialists don’t define workers by what they lack but by the potential power they possess.

*****

This complex division of labor allows relatively small groups of workers to produce or make possible huge productivity and profits—or jeopardize them by going on strike.

*****

The paradox of working-class power is that it originates in how individual workers are powerless.

*****

But it is this individual powerlessness that eventually compels workers to come together and organize collectively

*****

Middle-class people, by contrast, enjoy more individual autonomy than workers, which is why many workers dream of escaping their class and becoming managers or opening up their own businesses. But members of the middle class are pushed around by capitalists just like workers, only without the collective power to resist. The paradox of working-class power applies to the middle class in reverse. The very individualism of the small business owner who “doesn’t have to answer to anybody”

*****

workers—makes the middle class extremely ineffective as a collective body. In times of widespread class struggle, the middle class is like a gang of big toughs squaring off against an army regiment—it’s outmatched in terms of both discipline and firepower.

*****

Because the middle class contains traits of both workers and capitalists, it sees itself as the “everyman” representing all of society—as opposed to the “special interests” of workers (the actual majority of the country) and big capitalists. This is true in the sense that the middle class best represents within itself the class contradictions of capitalism, but that doesn’t help it find a way out of those contradictions. Without the individual power of capitalists or the collective power of workers, the political instinct of the middle class is to call on both sides to stop fighting. Because it can’t produce an alternative to capitalism that really would give everyone an equal voice, its calls for unity end up being window dressing for the status quo, which makes it an excellent breeding ground for politicians.

*****

The working class, by contrast, has the power to back up its words with action, but it only gains this power through a long process of learning how to organize itself.

*****

The group nature of working-class resistance doesn’t just help workers to extract some raises and better conditions from their bosses. It can also, in much more intense moments, point to a possible world without bosses, which makes workers different from many previous exploited classes.

*****

The essence of socialism is that workers can use this collective organization that they have learned under capitalism to create not just cooperative workplaces but a cooperative society geared to meet humanity’s needs instead of a competitive one geared to maximize profit.

*****

Marx came from a middle-class background himself, yet he viewed class conflict not as a neutral observer but as a participant on the side of the workers. Like the utopians, he recognized that the class struggle produced by capitalism is a nasty business. But unlike the middle-class reformers, he understood that the solution was not to wish the struggle out of existence but for the working class to win it and build a more just society.

*****

The simplest definition of Marx’s socialism is that it is what society would look like if the working class were in charge.

*****

the majority class would be in power for the first time in recorded history, which would lead to the gradual dissolving of classes themselves, since a majority can’t live off the exploited labor of a minority. This idea that socialism is defined by the ultimate victory of the working class is Marx’s most important contribution

*****

Solidarity

*****

Just to be clear, we are talking about potential, not describing reality.

*****

Why should we expect working people to be socialists and believe that their class is capable of running society when they are taught the opposite every day of their lives? From childhoods in underfunded schools to adulthoods in underpaid jobs, working-class people are taught to keep their heads down, follow orders, and keep their bright ideas to themselves. Then we turn on the TV to watch CEOs and action heroes celebrated for being free-spirited, rebellious, and every other quality that’s been drummed out of us. This is one of capitalism’s nasty habits: degrading people and then blaming them for their degradation. Black men are the last workers hired and the first ones fired, and then are demonized as deadbeat dads who don’t provide for their children. Girls are vilified for dressing the very way they’ve been told to by a thousand magazine covers. Later they will be blamed by those same magazines for neglecting their families to go to work, even while they are being blamed at work for taking time off for their families.

*****

Just as importantly, these are issues of freedom and dignity, which matter just as much to people as the size of their paycheck. If some workers ignore—or support—the oppressions of other workers, then real unity is impossible.
Working-class unity is not something to be proclaimed by ignoring racism, xenophobia, and other oppressions within the working class, but something to fight for by combatting them. Some critics of socialism claim that we prioritize class struggle over issues like racism and sexism. In fact, we see them as inseparable.

*****

lovers.”6Socialists aim to win workers to fight against oppression on the basis not of sympathy but of solidarity, the idea that this fight is in our mutual working-class interests

*****

At home on the couch, workers are just as likely as anyone else to buy whatever crappy ideas this society is selling. When they find themselves in a struggle, they make connections between themselves and others facing injustice

*****

We are living through a time when the number of strikes and the size of unions is at a historically low level. Its not just the oppression of the working class that’s hidden—so is its power. So it isn’t surprising that many people looking to fight oppression and injustice find that the idea that the workers will lead the way outdated and naïve.

*****

It’s true that the working class has undergone major changes.

*****

The global working class is bigger than it has ever been. What is often called deindustrialization is really a process in which factory jobs haven’t disappeared but relocated to places without unions in the United States and around the world.

*****

But the decline in the power of workers, like their numbers, is easily exaggerated. Pundits regularly dismiss unions as insignificant relics of the past, until a strike erupts and they freak out about how much chaos it will cause. Even then, they are often incapable of actually listening to the workers they now realize they depend on

*****

But how do we get from this particular present to socialism? How can tens of millions of workers become revolutionary? Through a revolution. That might seem like it gets the chronology wrong. We’re taught to view revolutions as the final step of a plan carried out by radical leaders, when in fact they are the process by which millions of ordinary people become radical leaders

What conservatives find to be “government tyranny” are those additional services taken on by twentieth-century governments around the world in response to popular demand: caring for the elderly and the sick, monitoring discrimination and the food supply, and so on.


　

Just as capitalism combines the tyranny of the individual owner with the anarchy of all the bosses’ competition with each other, it combines the repression of each state over its own population with the chaos of every state’s competition with every other for control of global trade and military dominance.

　

Socialists call this global anarchy imperialism, and it includes everything from warfare to diplomacy to trade agreements, whatever can give one nation a leg up


　6. Imagine
　

When governments enact laws, we look for how they might abuse their new powers. But when people come together to fight for even the smallest improvement at work, at school, or on the streets, we see the germs of a new form of society.

Revolution!

*****

Revolutions are the fullest expression of social life, when the majority of the population pushes away its self-appointed spokespeople and demands to make itself heard.

*****

Revolutions are not a single event but a process, which unfortunately involves many defeats, some of which are decisive and last decades, while others prove to be more temporary setbacks.

*****

reformism, which is the idea that we can not only win various reforms to make capitalism a little better for a little while but that by passing more and more progressive laws we can slowly but surely reform capitalism itself into a system that works for the majority of humanity. Reformism is an appealing strategy because it seems a lot more practical than revolution. The problem is that if your goal is socialism, reformism doesn’t work.
Socialism can’t be gradually voted into existence.

*****

It is only through the experiences of revolution that millions of workers go through the learning process necessary to run society

*****

not necessarily referring to military battles but intense conflicts between classes that could take many forms—from workplace occupations to creating new constitutions to street battles with police or soldiers. These conflicts can involve not just pain and loss but the exhilaration of discovering previously unknown capacities and skills—as individuals, as a class, and as a society.

*****

For socialists, being a revolutionary is not a state of mind, a style of protest,

*****

Instead it’s about understanding that capitalism inevitably produces revolutions and doing what you can to prepare for them so that theymight win—

*****

t means training ourselves and those who join us for the future—by reading and discussing the lessons of the past and fighting and learning how to win in the protest movements of the present.

*****

Revolutionaries, by contrast, want to make sure there’s time for political discussions so that people can explore new perspectives they’re gaining from their experience in the movement.

*****

People have good reason to be suspicious that socialists intend to simply use workers as an army to overturn capitalism and then turn on them once in power. History is filled with examples of rebellions that end with the masses being betrayed by the leaders they put into power.

*****

The first thing to understand about the Russian Revolution is that there was not one revolution but two: the overthrow of the tsar in February and the creation of a soviet government in October. The February revolution was not planned by Lenin—or anybody else. It exploded mostly spontaneously after a strike of women clothing workers spread across the capital cit

*****

The first Provisional Government was dominated by parties from the wealthy landowning and capitalist classes, which is also not unusual. After a tyrant is overthrown, the initial government to replace it often contains people who for the most part supported the old regime but now claim to have always been on the side of the people.

*****

For the elites in charge of the Provisional Government, democracy meant having an elected government—someday; they kept putting off the elections—that would maintain the tsar’s policies, most importantly continuing the war.
--
Ww1

*****

But the Provisional Government’s plans were challenged by new organizations created by the revolution called soviets, councils of elected representatives that started in the factories of the capital and then spread among workers, peasants, soldiers, students, women, neighborhoods, and villages. These soviets controlled the post office, railroads, and food distribution in the capital city, and as the year went on, their influence spread across the country. Military officers on the front could not even have their orders carried out without the approval of the soldiers’ council,

*****

The Bolsheviks were a minority force at the beginning of the revolution, but that changed as the year went on and the Provisional Government continued to find new excuses for not meeting the demands of workers and peasants, most of which began with “as soon as we win this war.” Through months of stormy protests, strikes, peasant uprisings, and army mutinies, the Bolsheviks grew from a few thousand based among the most radical factory workers to an organization of hundreds of thousands based in many workplaces and throughout the army and nav

*****

By the fall, Bolsheviks had been elected to the majority of the citywide soviets in the capital city,

*****

to take power from the official government. When they finally did in October, the move was so widely supported that there were almost no soldiers in the capital who defended the official government, although the fighting in other cities lasted for a few weeks.

*****

While the majority of Russian workers supported the October revolution, the more moderate socialist parties rejected it on the grounds that it was not democratic because it hadn’t been elected, a detail they hadn’t found objectionable in February when the tsar was overthrown without a formal vote having taken place.

*****

The fact is that every revolution happens without a vote: If the change people are looking for could happen within the election process, there would be no need to revolt.

*****

The first acts of the new soviet government were directed toward giving workers control of the factories and peasants control of the land—not through strict government control but through their own actions. These decrees called on the soviets and other popular committees of workers and peasants to take over the land and factories themselves. The Bolsheviks were using their control of the government to create a new kind of state based on people taking power for themselves.
Within weeks, the soviet government had called for an immediate end to Russia’s participation in the war and legalized divorce, abortion, and homosexuality—narrowly beating the United States on these progressive reforms by around fifty years or so. It also declared that nations controlled by the tsar’s empire had the right to declare independence and embarrassed Russia’s “democratic” allies England and France by publishing their secret plans to divide up the colonial territories of their enemies after the war.

*****

There were more uprisings to come in Germany and elsewhere, but no successful revolutions, which made the eventual failure of the Russian Revolution inevitable, as the Bolsheviks knew. They had always said that socialism couldn’t succeed if it was isolated in Russia

*****

faced starvation, while peasants were furious that the new government they had fought for was now taking their bread to feed the workers. As workers lost their strength and organization, real authority shifted from soviets to the bureaucracy of the Bolshevik government. Many peasants turned against the revolution and led uprisings that were suppressed. Leaders like Lenin and Trotsky publicly worried that the popular character of the revolution was deteriorating and urged government officials to maintain as much democratic culture as possible while waiting for new revolutions to break out in other countries and relieve Russia’s isolation

*****

countryside.9But some prominent Bolsheviks, led by Joseph Stalin, concluded that if the revolution wasn’t going to spread, it would be better to survive in power by creating an autocracy than to wait to be overthrown by foreign armies and the old Russian ruling classes. Stalin maneuvered his way into a dictatorship and launched a historic reign of terror, featuring slave labor camps and mass executions of political enemies. Every gain of the revolution was reversed: art and writing were rigorously censored, homosexuality and abortion were criminalized again, and women were told that being a good communist meant having lots of children for Mother Russia.

*****

The defeat from within of the Soviet Union was a decade-long process in which the soviets stopped functioning in conditions of war and mass poverty and the Bolshevik Party was left in charge of a state presiding over a devastated economy. As the party had to make more and more emergency decisions—often with the fate of the revolution on the line—the revolutionary dynamic of the people fighting for their own liberation completely shifted to a small number of ex-revolutionaries fighting for their own position as the leaders of the country

*****

After taking over the Bolshevik Party and government, Stalin and his allies manipulated the loyalty of the Communist parties that had formed around the world in 1917, handpicked new leaders who would blindly obey Moscow, and turned the primary function of these once-revolutionary parties into being cheerleaders for Russian foreign policy—

*****

The result was that in subsequent revolutions, Communist parties played the same role that the moderate socialists had played in Russia, arguing that the working class was not ready to take power.

*****

The tragic outcome of the Russian Revolution and the Communist parties it inspired has cast a shadow over every subsequent generation attempting to challenge capitalism. It has become widely accepted that working-class revolution is not possible or desirable—even among those who consider themselves anticapitalist revolutionaries.

*****

Workers are usually so busy being exploited and oppressed that they appear to have little interest in the major political questions of the day, much less the ability to solve them. But the seismic shift of revolution reveals that the class has more depth than was visible from the surface.

*****

Those who focus only on the chaos and violence of revolutions imply that there is a peaceful democratic alternative. But revolutions occur precisely because there isn’t. They are emergency measures taken spontaneously by large numbers of people, and, being emergency measures, they are usually not carefully planned and thought through. They almost always happen before the conditions are fully ripe for them to succeed. And so when they break out, there are always various people, some of whom may even have spent much of their lives thinking they would support a revolution, who when finally faced with one declare that now is not the time, that the working class isn’t ready. But it’s only through the process of revolution, daunting as it is, that workers can become ready.

*****

The role of revolutionaries is not to create revolutions but to prepare for them.

*****

What I’ve been describing, a revolutionary project based on the potential of the working class to overthrow capitalism and create a classless society, is more properly known as Marxism.

*****

One strand of socialism is social democracy, which can be seen in its classic form today in some of the large socialist parties in Europe. A hundred years ago, these parties claimed to support the overthrow of capitalism by the working class but argued that this would occur not through revolutionary upheavals but via gradual implementation from elected governments. On this basis they opposed the Bolshevik-led revolution for being undemocratic. Over the course of the twentieth century, many of these parties won elections and had the chance to implement their lofty rhetoric of socialist transformation. In every case, they limited themselves to (at best) enacting programs of free health care and education that represented major progress but didn’t challenge the overall authority of the capitalist class to run the economy based on profit. As the capitalists and social democrats learned how to coexist—and even get along—social democracy moved away from even mild reformism. Today most of these parties model themselves after the Democratic Party, which former Republican strategist Kevin Phillips once called “the world’s second-most enthusiastic capitalist party

*****

The revolutionary socialists who supported the Russian Revolution eventually split between the Stalinist Communist parties and the far smaller Trotskyist organizations that opposed the Soviet Union’s turn toward dictatorship and argued that socialism must be both revolutionaryanddemocratic.

By the middle of the twentieth century, socialism became defined as either mild social democracy on the one hand, or one-party “people’s” dictatorships on the other.
