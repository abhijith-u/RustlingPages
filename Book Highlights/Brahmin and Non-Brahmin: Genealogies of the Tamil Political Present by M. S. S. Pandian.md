#### Brahmin and Non-Brahmin: Genealogies of the Tamil Political Present by M. S. S. Pandian

#### 1. Introduction: The Politics of the Emergent
- The very term ‘non-Brahmin’, in its lexicalization, makes the Brahmin central. The normalization of the category non- Brahmin—i.e. the process of making it a transparent, naturalized, and sedimented category—simultaneously reconfigured the preexisting Brahmin identity. More specifically, this book maps the historical and political conjunctures that led to the formation of Brahmin and non-Brahmin as objects of discourse: the enunciative modalities which delimited the ways in which Brahmin and non-Brahmin were talked about, and how these figures acquired over time their concrete meanings.

	This choice is the consequence of two dominant, but problematic, approaches found in the existing literature on non-Brahmin politics in South India.
	- First, some of the key texts on non-Brahmin politics trivialize non-Brahmin identity as fictive despite its materialization and real consequences.
	- The second tendency in the existing literature is to treat the emergence of non-Brahmin identity as structurally inevitable. That is, its emergence holds no surprise at all. This is a tendency one also finds in popular histories of the non-Brahmin movement written by its ideologues.

- Colonialism is not merely a backdrop but a key player in the story of the making and normalization of Brahmin and non-Brahmin identities. Colonialism was many things at once—violent in the name of ‘civilizing’, economically extractive in the name of ‘modernizing’, and naïvely labelling in the name of gathering ‘knowledge’. These oxymoronic pairings point to ever-present contradictions in and the instability of the colonial project, but enframing the colonized into a set of categories and the constant reiteration of those categories did produce its own reality. The colonized mobilized and deployed these categories to work for varying ends. In other words, colonial categories acquired and changed their connotation through the uses to which they were put. Colonialism thus abetted and also provided the grounds for articulating and bringing into being new identities as much as it sought to freeze identities. National identity is perhaps the most obvious of these.
	Colonialism prepared the grounds for interpretive crises and possibilities. These twin aspects of colonialism facilitated the making and normalization of non-Brahmin identity in opposition to a resignified Brahmin identity.

#### 2. Becoming Brahmin in Colonial Tamil Nadu

- Missionary labour, in the terrain of identity-making encounters, was qualitatively different from the identity-framing practices of the state, practices such as colonial ethnography and census enumeration. The state’s activities were based on the notion of sovereignty, which the missionaries lacked. Importantly, colonial governmentality, as argued by David Scott, ‘put in place a public sphere in which only certain kinds of knowledges and not others . . . could circulate with any efficiency; a sphere in which fluency in these knowledges . . . would be a condition of participation; and in which participation would be the only rational and legal way of exercising influences in what now counts as politics.’

- Given their need to compare Hinduism with Christianity so that missionaries could at least try convincing natives, missionaries produced a flood of literature that tried to contain Hinduism’s fluidity and fix its meaning. By 1832, more than 40,000 tracts were printed in Tamil alone and by 1852 there were 2,10,000.

	As part of the missionary discourse which projected and thus externalized Hinduism as an object of debate in the colonial public sphere, caste too came to acquire its ‘objectness’. Treating caste as an impediment to both conversion and to the practice of Christian life, missionaries innovated various methods to ensure that both native clergy and their congregations were free from caste. Upper-caste converts, in an attempt to keep their identity separate from lower castes, claimed that caste was social and not religious. The lower castes, in contrast, tried to use the new opportunity to affirm new norms of equality.

- Often, missionary narratives about Brahmins exhibited a dual consciousness—envy for his philosophically-inclined religious and literary culture, and contempt for his ritually-driven pantheistic religious beliefs and practices because these were said to have reproduced caste as a system of power and subordination. The Brahmin had now to strive hard to affirm at once his religion as authentic (to consolidate European admiration for his religion as a way of firming up his power) and as modern (to stave off European criticism of his religious practices and the practice of caste, so to legitimize his power).

- One of the major organized responses to the Christian challenge took the form of a public meeting on 7 October 1846 in Madras, a meeting of the ‘Hindu community of Madras’ organized at Pachayappa’s Institution at Popham’s Broadway. Suntharalingam notes, ‘this was the first known Hindu gathering in Madras which had all the trappings of a modern political protest meeting: the permission of the Sheriff of Madras was secured; a chairman was elected to conduct the meeting; a number of resolutions were passed; and a memorial was approved and signed for submission to the government.’ Here, the basic features of a modern ideological movement were developed—printing press, newspaper, tracts, distribution network, meetings, membership lists, mufassal agent, and organised campaigns to influence “public” opinion.

	Similar efforts were again afoot in the 1880s. In 1881 the Hindu Preaching Society was founded and in 1887 Sivasankara Pandiah, a Gujarati Brahmin, founded the Hindu Tract Society. Hindu preachers countered Christian missionaries by ‘preaching, singing and distributing tracts against the Christian faith’ in the very places where missionaries preached. Western rationalist literature had a wide circulation among Hindu groups in the Tamil-speaking region, and Madras functioned as a sort of rationalist headquarters for the rest of British India.

- These acts of ‘replication’ and the speaking of a language similar to that used by Christian missionaries was the result of the conventions of the colonial public sphere as well as of Hindus imbibing the Christian notion that religion ought to be an institutionalized entity and a singular body rather than a disparate set of loosely linked practices. Imagining heterogeneous Hindu religious practices in terms of a single institutionalized religion led to different groups claiming that their beliefs and practices were the essence of the Hindu religion. The Brahminical and Saivite claims were the most important of these in the Tamil-speaking region during colonialism.

- Not only had the Brahmin to negotiate his loss of authority to the Englishman, who was no better than an outcaste, the larger fact was that the world had changed vastly with colonialism. This change, which encompassed a range of things—from the conduct of everyday rituals to what he ate and drank—put the Brahmin’s claim to Brahminhood under great stress. One of the many ways in which Tamil Brahmins responded to this crisis was to look for discursive and other means to ‘recover’ the so-called authentic but now lost Brahminical tradition.

-  Claiming the Brahminic as the national was an important move made by Tamil Brahmins. It was a move which implicitly reduced non-Brahmins and religious minorities as being inadequately Indian. The desire to recover the supposedly lost authenticity of the Brahmin was essentially a desire among English-educated Brahmins who were at once seduced by and constrained to work within the framework of colonial modernity for education, jobs, and social interaction. The twin roles—being authentic and being modern—which this Brahmin tried to balance in his everyday life was his inheritance from the contradictory demands of colonialism. It was a balancing act which both opened up as well as limited new possibilities for the Brahmin in this period. 

- This search for authenticity, or the desire to be ‘outside time’, was accompanied by a careful move by Brahmins to present extant Brahminical practices as always already modern. A number of publications in the first half of the twentieth century tried to present untouchability as a social practice based on modern rationality. There is no sign here at all of caste pollution as ritual prohibition. The upper castes casually get encoded as ‘pious and religious people’ or as ‘religious people of pure habits’ while the lower castes are encoded as ‘people living on rotten fish, flesh, garlic etc.’ Fish, flesh, and garlic are of course all taboo in the gastronomic and ritual universe of Brahmins. The deployment of such ‘casteless’ secularized language is so transparently a move to validate untouchability as scientific.

- Like ritual pollution, the caste system itself, in an even bolder move, was claimed by Brahmins to be scientific. In their hands it was often reinvented as a form of division of labour. The act of naturalizing caste as division of labour and of denying its specificity renders it similar to a Western institution— hence universal and modern. A space for religious reform, which could be represented to the colonizers as a process of becoming modern, is being salvaged in the name of re-establishing Brahmin authenticity.

- The debate among Tamil Brahmins on the questions of authenticity and religious reform produced a new space for claiming Brahminic Hinduism, based on Sanskrit texts, as authentically Hindu. This process was aided and abetted and energized primarily by two of the intellectual currents of the times, namely Orientalism and Theosophy.

	Friedrich Max Müller (1823–1900), who was repeatedly and almost reverentially invoked by Tamil Brahmins in their deliberations on Hinduism, is an important figure in this story. First, Müller took great pains to dispel the argument that Sanskrit is a dead language spoken by none and locked in esoteric texts. Establishing a close link between priestly Brahmins and the Vedic literature, and attributing their decline to the invading Turanians, Müller offers the Brahmins a claim over Vedic Hinduism as the original Indian religion. He also portrays the Turanians as their enemies. Turanians were understood in the pan-Indian context as lower castes and as the ‘original’ inhabitants of the southern part of India. The Theosophical Society played an important role in popularizing the ideas of Orientalists, including those of Müller, and were at the forefront of promoting Brahminical Hinduism as authentic Hinduism.

 - Inspired and supported by the Theosophical Society, a network of other organizations sprang into existence and began propagating Brahminical Hinduism as true Hinduism. Perhaps the most wellknown of them was the Hindu Tract Society founded in 1887 by Sivasankara Pandiah. In the course of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries this new Brahminical Hinduism was asserted as the essence of India by Tamil Brahmins, marginalizing various other forms of being Hindu.

 - Subranania Iyer (1855-1916) and five other Brahmins launched the first issue of The Hindu, a weekly newspaper  by him  and printed at the Srinidhi Press in Madras, appeared on 20 September 1878. His most important nationalist text, namely Arya Jana Ikiyam Allathu Congress Mahasabhai (Unity of the Aryan People or the Congress Party) was  published in 1888.
 
	 India’s geographical expanse and huge population were a matter of pride for Iyer.  The Aryans, who ‘never fear battles’, were aggressors against new regions and their inhabitants, their aggression was only ‘impelled by the love for their religion. Iyer did not find it necessary to name those who were the target of wars waged by his Aryans: in his scheme of things their culture, religion, and other lived aspects seem unworthy of mention. Here is elision and sweet slippage from conquest to the observance of dharma by conquerors, the invention of conquest as a morally-grounded project outside modern notions of sovereignty. 

	According to him, as the various streams of Aryans moved and settled in the different parts of India, they lost touch with each other. Their mutual isolation over long periods caused them to acquire the appearance of different communities. This story of the unity of Indians based on a commonly shared religion called Hinduism is simultaneously a claim to authenticity, and is therefore based on the logic of exclusion

	The Hinduism of the Indians elaborated by Iyer is undoubtedly the Hinduism of the Brahmins as redefined by Orientalist discourse. Vedas as truth, Sanskrit as deva basha, canonized religious texts such as the Ramayanam, Mahabharatam, Bhagavatam, Dharma Sastras and Smritis, as well as festivals like Sivarathiri, Devi Puja, and Gokulashtami have an emblematic presence in Brahminical Hinduism. As one moves down the caste hierarchy of the Hindus, all these texts and festivals disappear and what one has is a distinctly different domain of religiosities. Thus, what we have in Iyer is the reinscription of Brahminical Hinduism as the Hinduism and as the sign of Indianness, an identity between Indian nationalism and Brahminical Hinduism as envisioned by Iyer.

	Towards recovering the authentic national self in Brahminical Hinduism, Iyer also presented Islam as its Other. Though he was critical of Buddhism he was especially attentive to Islam, which he treated as a foreign religion, and represents a fairly standard Hindu nationalist critique of Islam in India, and simultaneously recovering Brahminical Hinduism as socially progressive. Both these claims are essential for Iyer’s anchoring of the nation in Brahminical Hinduism
