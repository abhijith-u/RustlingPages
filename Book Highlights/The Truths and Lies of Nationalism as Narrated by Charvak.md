##### India is Not a Pluralist Secular Democracy

- In broad terms, Gandhi believed that Indians were a religious people and that Indian society was held together by religion. Everywhere, there was a common truth which was a mutual respect for the ways of living of others. This sometimes meant mutually agreed rules of separation: we will not interfere when you carry your idols in a procession, just as you will not play music in front of our mosques when we pray. Rules of separation had been worked out and were well understood. These practices varied from region to region, from one locality to another. Outside the strict control of scripture and rules of orthodoxy, this was the ordinary religious life, which, Gandhi believed, contained the essential truth of religious tolerance.

  His location was never within some secular space of the state, unmarked by religious difference. Then why did Gandhi fail in his attempt to keep the country together? To give you a short answer, I think it was because he put the entire burden of maintaining tolerance and harmony on the self-regulating mechanisms of society. Gandhi was fundamentally against the use of government machinery or the law to influence or change religious customs, even when he agreed that those customs might be harmful or unjust. Social self-regulation of the Gandhian kind became a victim of the politics of majorities and minorities.

 
- There was a different approach taken by those who were learned in the sacred texts to make the same point – that the Hindu religion taught tolerance and respect for all religions. Swami Vivekananda was one of the first among them. Interestingly, in his Chicago speech in 1893, although he mentioned Jews and Zoroastrians as communities which had been given shelter in India, Vivekananda did not once mention Islam as a religion that was also practised by many in the country.

  The use of the Advaita Vedanta to claim that, despite countless differences in doctrine and practice, the Hindu religion has a fundamental unity served a clear political purpose. It asserted that from ancient times the people of India had the cultural resources in their religious tradition to respect differences while, at the same time, uniting to pursue common tasks. The

- Rabindranath Tagore was also a renowned figure who spoke of unity in diversity. He was born in a Brahmo family. Yet Rabindranath was resolutely opposed to nationalism. In fact, he argued that precisely because Indian society had achieved its cohesion while preserving its diversity, it must not copy Europe and try to become a nation. European nations were racially and culturally homogeneous. Indian society would be destroyed if the cultural politics of nationalism was imposed on it.

  The political effect was to privilege the Hindu religion and its associated culture as the adhesive (bandhan) that held together a nation otherwise divided into numerous castes, sects, and communities. I say this was a political effect because without the new impulse to project the existence of an Indian nation that could make a rightful claim of self-government against the British colonial power, this particular vision of something called the Hindu religion would have been irrelevant. It became a political metaphor of nationalism.

  This had two important consequences. First, other religious traditions became minor or subordinate elements that illustrated diversity while the Hindu tradition became the force that united and gave shelter to others. The second effect followed from the first. It provided philosophical and cultural legitimacy to the politics of Hindu majoritarianism.

  

- Nehru told a story in which the religious pluralism of local societies was brought together with the administrative policies of the state to picture the vibrant presence of a common culture that united the Indian nation. The historical version of unity in diversity, combining culture and state policy, has become synonymous with Nehruvian secularism.

  The particular version of pluralism popularised by Nehru emphasised the fact that it was fostered not merely by cultural exchanges among different groups of people but actively promoted and enforced by the administrative machinery of the state. Hence, the history of pluralist civilisation in India is as much a cultural history as a history of state policy. This leads to the detailed study of the great state formations which, for reasons of their large territorial scale and robust administrative structures, have left behind the largest volume of records on how they functioned. As a result, the history of pluralism, or unity in diversity, in India is marked by a succession of great empires – the Maurya, the Gupta, the Delhi Sultanates, the Vijayanagara, the Mughal, the Maratha, the British. The history of Indian civilisation is not the history of everyone who lives in India. On the contrary, by glorifying the culture of the powerful, the wealthy, and the learned, it produces a myopic view of what is valuable in the nation’s past.

  
- What is the implication for a national idea that is pluralist? The lesson is that one must have a centralised bureaucratic state claiming sovereignty over the whole territory of the country and enforcing state policies of non-interference in religious freedom and toleration of difference. But this immediately creates a problem. The territory of the country, as I have explained to you already, is, for the most part, as it was left behind by our British rulers. This territory does not coincide with those of any of the earlier empires. Consequently, the search for a historical tradition of the pluralist state inevitably privileges the Maurya Empire under Asoka or the Mughal Empire under Akbar which had both a large expanse of territory and a record of religious tolerance.

  This, if you think about it carefully, has the effect of focusing the geographical imagination of pluralist India on the Gangetic plains of northern India as the ground from which policies for promoting diversity must spring that could be put into practice by a centralised bureaucracy. Examples from other parts of the country where smaller kingdoms, such as in Kerala or Kashmir or Bijapur or the Tamil region or Manipur, may have also promoted pluralism but in ways that were quite different were marginalised because they did not have the imperial scale of the state that men like Nehru envisioned for independent India.

  The historical examples of pluralist state policy involved large polities ruled by enlightened monarchs surrounded by ministers and courtiers drawn from elite circles. None of them were democracies that had to be ruled with the express consent of the people. How could such a history inform state policy in republican India?


- In the first two decades after independence, Nehru and other liberal-minded politicians, bureaucrats, and lawyers put in place the laws and administrative practices of what is known as Nehruvian secularism. Even though the new republic began its journey towards democracy, it was still led by an enlightened elite surrounded by the aura of being the liberators of the nation. By the late 1960s, it became clear that the secular outlook of enlightened pluralists would have to be modified and, some might say, corrupted in order to cope with the pressures of democracy.

- Secularism was invented in this country no earlier than the 1930s. Before that, there was no word in any Indian language to mean what is now meant by secularism. The idea emerged in the particular context of what was happening in Indian politics, especially in northern India, at the time. Most of the time, and in most ordinary contexts, the primary community with which a person would identify was the caste (_jāti_) to which he or she belonged. But a _jāti_ was defined within a limited geographical region. On occasions when a larger community was defined by the name Hindu, the castes that were included in it varied from region to region. Further, nowhere were the untouchable castes included within the category of Hindu.

- The movement in UP to separate Hindi from Urdu in the early-twentieth century was a major step in the growth of the awareness that there was a Hindu majority in northern India that could be mobilised; second, it was explicitly posed as a counter to the perceived cultural dominance of an old Muslim gentry; and third, that its immediate objective was to secure a firm foothold for upper-caste Hindus in the expanding structures of the bureaucracy and the education system.

- Even though India’s leaders wanted the new state to be secular, it became clear at the time of making the constitution that foreign models would not work. Something different – an Indian variety of secularism – would have to be invented. It guaranteed every person the freedom of conscience and the right to freely practise, profess, and propagate religion. But at the same time, the state was given the power to restrict any economic, political, or other secular activity associated with a religious practice, and reform Hindu religious institutions and open them to all Hindus

	Religion should concern only beliefs and ceremonial rituals. In all other matters, the state must be allowed to make laws to ensure social progress. Nonetheless, apart from individual freedom of religion, limited by the power of state intervention, the constitution also recognised the rights of religious communities. Thus every religious denomination was given the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage its own religious affairs, and own and administer property in accordance with the law. Further, it allowed religious and linguistic minorities to establish and maintain their own educational institutions and prohibited the state from discriminating against them in granting financial aid. Interestingly, while the constitution prohibited religious instruction in any institution wholly maintained by state funds, it allowed such instruction in schools and colleges set up by a religious endowment or trust even if it received government grants, provided individual students were not forced to attend such sessions against their wishes.

	What emerged as Indian secularism did not fit the definitions of the secular state anywhere else in the world. There was no strict separation since the state was allowed to intervene in religion. At the same time, the state was not entirely neutral between different religions since it intervened in some religions more than in others. The argument was made that this was necessary because the social and political considerations were different

- Once the state decided to make laws to give itself powers to engage with religion, secularism in India became centrally concerned with the law. The basic problem was one of determining the exact line within which the state may justifiably intervene in the activities of religious institutions and beyond which things must be left in the hands of religious authorities. Judges began to define and draw this line by interpreting religious texts and customs and deciding what was essential to that religion.

	In defining the essence of religion, judges tended to privilege an abstract philosophical conception of religion, supported by modern interpretations of religious texts, and were dismissive of popular practices that appeared to be mere superstition. Religious leaders in the old days would take their disputes to the king with the expectation that he would provide an impartial resolution. Now that the British had left, our judges began to think of the court as playing the role of an impartial but socially progressive monarch. British judges began the practice of including in their judgments their interpretation of these supposedly traditional laws so that Indian litigants would be satisfied that the foreign judges were not acting out of ignorance. As a result, by the time of independence, legal precedents on the personal and religious laws of Hindus and Muslims were full of these judicial interpretations of religious texts. Indian judges, deeply familiar with these precedents, continued the same practice after independence, to the extent of following the same linguistic idiom. If you read the language used in our court judgments these days, you will notice that most judges have read their dharmashastra in English translation and argue on Indian religions like British judges in colonial times

##### India is a People’s Federation

- When the very lives of people are at stake, it is the state and not the national government which comes to the forefront, as seen during the Covid pandemic.

- The territories and peoples that are now part of India do not have some mysterious bond of unity going back to antiquity. They have been brought together into a single political unit as a result of British conquests, Indian political movements and their internal divisions, the negotiated transfer of power and partition, and the integration into the Indian Union of the princely states and the French and Portuguese colonial possessions. There is a particular legal framework that defines the relations between the different units of the federation with the centre. That framework too has evolved since the constitution was written.

	The constitutional history is a history of the state structure. It describes how, after the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, the British conquered territory, subjugated the regional kingdoms, and put together a new imperial political order. That is the basic state structure, embellished by constitutional reforms in the twentieth century, which the independent Indian state inherited. True, it enveloped all that within a new democratic and republican constitution. But the basic logic by which the state machinery functioned was still imperial.

- People often forget that the fundamental step towards building a democratic federation in India was taken a hundred years ago when the Indian National Congress, soon after Gandhi became its leader, decided to reorganise its provincial committees along linguistic lines, disregarding the provincial boundaries created by the colonial state. It was a crucial move that enabled the national movement to strike deep roots in different parts of the country and send its message to millions beyond the small upper-class elite. 

- The leaders whose politics had been to oppose the colonial bureaucracy were now in charge of that bureaucracy, their priorities suddenly changed. They felt that the need of the hour was to preserve the state machinery; democracy could wait. It is remarkable how Congress leaders who had earlier thrived on mass movements now became apprehensive of popular mobilisation. 

	The state came down to us through a history that was imperial. Regardless of our new democratic constitution, the inner principle by which the machinery of the state works is still imperial.

- The multilingual character of the Indian nation reflects the unique fact that the Indian nation is a federation of peoples  – many peoples, each formed by the bonds of a language. The Indian nation is the result of the fact that many peoples speaking many languages agreed to come together to form a single nation with a single democratic and federal state. While the people of each linguistic region accepted that it belonged to the Indian nation, each had a different idea of what this Indian nation meant. Those were the terms under which all of these peoples agreed to come together in a federation. The myth of Aryavarta as the centre of Indian civilisation, the history of successive imperial states, and the emergence of Hindi as a language of public discourse have combined to create the widely held impression that the upper-caste North Indian Hindu male speaking Hindi, whether as mother tongue or an adopted language, is the typical representative Indian.

- **The freedom struggle in several parts of India was against British rule but she had nothing to do with "Indian nationalism".**

	The Indian nation undoubtedly exists in every part of the country. But in each region, the people with a shared language developed a specific conception of their nationhood while, at the same time, defining their place within the larger Indian nation. This truth demands that the Indian state grant a legitimate and equal political place within the Indian national federation to each of these constituent but different peoples. That is the truth which has been denied so far by the Indian state, regardless of which party has held power.

	- The federal structure in which states are mainly monolingual, reflecting democratic solidarities produced in each case by the sharing of a common linguistic heritage, but also roughly equal in their participation and influence. You must remember that federalism operates with territorial units. The state (*rājya*) is not identical to the nation (*rāṣṭra*). The former has been inherited from our imperial rulers; the latter is constituted by the people (*lok*) themselves. The people of each state have agreed to live together with the people of all the other states within the same Indian constitution because they have, each in their own way, negotiated the terms of the union. This is, therefore, the first principle: each constituent people of the Indian union is different and must be recognised and respected as such

	- The second principle is that while the people of each state is different in quality (guṇ), in its status (sammān) within the federation each is equal to the others. This is not merely a matter of being formally equal in law. It must be an active principle in the functioning of the federation. This is precisely the reason why it is unwise to have some states that are so much larger than the others that they can wield a degree of power that causes resentment within the federation. But relative size is only one aspect of the problem. Even greater is the problem of perception. If some people feel that they are the original and permanent members of the nation and others have been admitted only as a gesture of goodwill or perhaps by political necessity, then the rule of equal respect is violated

	- The third principle is that the people must have priority, not the state machinery

		The demand for linguistic states was opposed on the plea that it would disrupt the stability of the state. Policy in Jammu and Kashmir has been driven most of the time by giving priority to the Indian state’s relation with the Pakistani state: the wishes of the Kashmiri people have played almost no role at all. The Indian government’s policy in the north-east in the last seventy years has been similarly dictated by the urge to secure a border region: the people who live there have been considered too few in number and too insignificant in influence to matter. No surprise, therefore, that Kashmir and the north-east are regions where it is considered legitimate to deploy the armed forces against Indian citizens.

		Why is the state given priority over the people? Who gives it this priority? It is those who think they have primary ownership of the Indian state because, as representatives of the essential core of the Indian nation, they have inherited the state from the British. They believe it is their duty to protect and preserve the state against people who they see as newcomers who don’t share the same view of nationalism and whose loyalties to the nation are questionable. Those who hold this view are not just a handful of patriarchal politicians and stuffy bureaucrats. The equation between the preservation of the existing state machinery and the interest of the core of the nation is assumed by an influential part of the Indian people

- From the late-nineteenth century, the idea of an Indian nation originating in ancient Vedic society took hold among educated Indians. It was solidified into a fully developed nationalist ideology in northern and western India in the early-twentieth century through the claim that the Hindus of this region were the first and most genuine Indian nationalists. In Maharashtra, this took the form of the celebration of Shivaji and the Brahman-led Maratha Empire. In northern India, the key elements of this nationalist ideology were the Sanskrit tradition, memories of Rajput resistance to Muslim conquest, and the rise of Hindi instead of Urdu as the language of education and government. From the mid-twentieth century, these two streams have converged to form a nationalist ideology which emphasises the need for a strong state machinery, centralised as far as possible, that is able to display a nation unified in its tradition and culture. In the first three decades after independence, this ideology was able to accommodate the idea of a pluralist democracy. In more recent times, however, it has been swamped by waves of nationalist propaganda that declares India to be a Hindu Rashtra whose tradition and culture are genuinely represented only by upper-caste Hindus who also speak Hindi.

- This shift in the cultural content of nationalism can also be seen in the way the idea of Indian citizenship has changed. In 1950, Articles 5 to 11 of the constitution declared that anyone living in India who did not claim citizenship of another country was an Indian citizen. There was no question about one’s religion or language nor was the nationality of one’s parents relevant. This idea of citizenship was strengthened by the Citizenship Act of 1955 which declared that anyone born in India was entitled to Indian citizenship

	But this enlightened idea of Indian citizenship was cast aside in 2003 when the Vajpayee government amended the Citizenship Act to bring in a completely different idea – that of being descended from Indians. At the same time, the 2003 amendment granted overseas citizenship to people of Indian origin who had left the country to become citizens of other countries. It was meant to flatter the nationalist egos of those who had abandoned their country to grab the chance of bringing up their children in the West

##### People’s Alliances Strengthen the Nation

whether secularist or Hindu nationalist, every policy that adopts a single, uniform, and integrated view of national culture inevitably gets reduced to a justification in terms of the dominant Sanskrit-based elite tradition of northern India. Many of the detailed proposals in the policy were suggested in the 1970s. They were then presented as elements of a policy to promote pluralist secularism. But the rhetoric was for the most part exactly the same

==========

  

The technological conditions of modernity have a certain universal global quality

==========

  

But it makes the nationalist educator deeply anxious. If all we are doing is copying formulas that have worked in other countries, what happens to the distinctness of our culture? How is the next generation to be educated in it? That is the reason why even the most ambitious modernising effort must be presented as nothing other than an affirmation of ancient Indian heritage

==========

  

This nationalist reasoning is not only false but pernicious

==========

  

metallurgy, and medicine, these were neither produced nor taught in places like Nalanda or Vikramshila, which were vihār for śramaṇ monks, nor in the Brahman’s gurukul, but in the families and workshops of master specialists in those occupations

==========

  

these random insertions of elements from the so-called Sanskrit knowledge systems occur because even the slightest similarity is believed to be sufficient to justify the claim that modern education is nothing, and indeed must be nothing, but the elaboration of a pedagogical ideal well established in India’s ancient past. The superficial scattering of Sanskrit names and concepts fosters a vague spirit of reverence for a particular cultural heritage without encouraging its critical appraisal

==========


I doubt very much that ancient knowledge will be presented to students in a critical spirit. That is not the function it serves in India’s education system. The knowledge that students are expected to master is the knowledge of modern science and technology. The Sanskrit knowledge systems, presented as a seamless, placid, and harmonious whole, are intended to produce reverence and docility. This is confirmed by what the policy says about the ethical ideals that must inspire young students. They must be taught traditional Indian values such as sevā, ahiṃsā, and niṣkām karma. While lip service is paid to local and tribal knowledge, there is no doubt at all that the student’s ethical world is to be defined by the dominant values of Brahmanical patriarchy.




One of the most astonishing features of the policy is its repeated insistence on teaching the Fundamental Duties as listed in Article 51A of the constitution.




First of all, it did not exist in the original constitution and was introduced by Indira Gandhi’s government in 1976 during the Emergency, along with the terms “secular” and “socialist”. As far as I know, no liberal constitution in the world describes anything called the fundamental duties of citizens – it is a concept that belongs to the authoritarian state.




it was first introduced in the constitution of the USSR under Stalin in 1936: that constitution, of course, no longer exists. It is also mentioned in the constitution of China. The constitution of Japan, written by American lawyers after Japan’s defeat in the Second World War, also has a section of this kind, because the Americans were worried that the Japanese might not be loyal to the new state that was being imposed on them.




the citizens of the country, in return for the rights that the state had given them, must be required to perform certain duties for the state. If a citizen did not care for the duties, he did not deserve the rights. The duties included respect for the national flag and national anthem, defending the country and rendering national service when asked, preserving religious and linguistic diversity and India’s composite culture, developing a scientific temper, protecting public property, and avoiding violence. If you remember what I told you about pluralist secular democracy, you will recognise these as elements of Nehruvian secularism packaged in the authoritarian rhetoric of Indira Gandhi’s Emergency.




That, hopefully, will produce meek and contented citizens who will not feel entitled by the constitution they have given to themselves to question those in positions of authority.




the proponents of Hindutva, for all their diatribes against the Nehru legacy, have shown their secret fondness for Indira Gandhi’s authoritarianism. It fully conforms to their ideal of a strong nation-state ruled by a cakravartin, the universal emperor eulogised by Kautilya.




The Persistence of Caste




by bringing back the main focus of political life in the country from the centre to the states, we will be able to address contentious issues closer to the level where policies are actually implemented. That way, there will be much greater opportunity for the people to make meaningful and effective alliances among themselves that will actually strengthen, not weaken, the nation. It is a completely false idea that a centralised nation-state displaying its force of unity at the top in a strong party or a strong leader is the sign of a strong nation. The strength of a nation of such diversity as India can only be built on the basis of strong alliances among the people (lokămitratā) at the state and local levels.




You might say that the BJP is doing something all parties are expected to do in an electoral democracy. But there is something else in the BJP strategy that the regional parties lack. With their organised strength from Gujarat and Maharashtra in the west to all the states in North India and the loud and visible presence of Hindutva proponents in the Hindi media, the BJP can project the image of a party that can hold power on its own at the centre. On that image is superimposed the image of Narendra Modi as a self-made OBC who has risen above caste identities to become a national leader rivalled by no one else. Yet, at the same time, the upper-caste representation in parliament has increased substantially in 2014 and 2019 while Muslim representation has fallen to the lowest point ever, almost entirely because of the caste composition of BJP members. It is its identification with central power that characterises the BJP today in every state and distinguishes it from all other parties, including the Congress, which no longer retains a position even as the main national opposition. When people vote for the BJP in state elections, they do so with the knowledge that it controls the immense resources of the central government.




The Nation Belongs to the Entire People




The Changing Middle Class




political parties and leaders may win elections and form governments, but they are able to do so only because they are supported by powerful groups in society which in turn expect to be rewarded by policies that favour them.




The political leaders of the Congress as well as bureaucrats, judges, journalists, scientists, teachers – people who shaped opinion and framed policies – were from the urban middle class. They were the personnel who ran the government.




They were the leaders of every political party. They also ran the bureaucracy, the judiciary, the armed forces, colleges and universities, the scientific institutions, the press, the publishing houses, and the film industry. The middle class was the principal force that shaped the policy of planned industrial development in the heyday of Congress rule.




It was careful not to upset the big businessmen too much, even though several industries were nationalised. After all, the Congress depended on the financial support of businessmen at the time of elections.




This gave rise in the field of politics to the art of speaking in two voices.




On all subjects and at every level, there emerged a gap between policy and its implementation. Policies were clothed in high-sounding but vague slogans while implementation was slipshod. This was not because of inefficiency or incompetence. It was a necessary part of the politics of balancing the interests of various powerful groups. If there was corruption in the failure to strictly implement the laws, it was part of the system by which the country was ruled.




The strategy of green revolution was adopted to subsidise big farmers and encourage them to increase the production of food crops. This led, in the 1970s, to the growing political power of big farmers, especially in northern India.




The size and character of the middle class also began to change. In the first three decades after independence, the Indian middle class was intimately tied to government service and the public sector.




But as secondary education expanded rapidly from the 1970s, there emerged a bifurcation in the cities between English-medium and vernacular-medium schools.




The effects were felt in higher education after the disturbances in 1989 over the implementation of the Mandal commission recommendations on reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBC) and the liberalisation of the economy in 1991. The elite section of the middle class increasingly dissociated itself from the public education system, preferring to send its children to expensive English-medium schools and private colleges and universities




this division of the middle class into an all-India elite section and the regional sections constitutes a very important factor in contemporary Indian politics.




The green revolution strategy adopted in the late 1960s had made the big farmers a powerful force not only in the states but even in national politics.




But this spell of prominence of big farmers in national politics did not last long. Reforms introduced after the liberalisation decision saw the withdrawal of government from many sectors of the economy. Corporate business houses began to flourish. Foreign investments started flowing




The urban middle class was now sold on the magic of the free market, globalisation, and the brilliance of Indian entrepreneurs. The farmers were reduced to a declining pressure group in state politics.




Indira Gandhi had thrown aside the old Congress model of an election machine based on strong state-level leaders and built a party that was completely centralised, held together by total loyalty to a single leader.




It was clear that the framework of the party had solidified into a centralised power structure headed by what was effectively a royal family and nothing could change it.

By Rajiv Gandhi's time




There are two major social groups in India that have a strong interest in centralising the power of government. One of them consists of the big corporate business houses.




Not surprisingly, the leaders of corporate houses try hard to influence central policies in their favour. They do so through their trade associations as well as by seeking to influence public opinion through the media. They also use more invisible methods such as financing the election campaigns of national parties and developing close personal relations with important political leaders.




As growth rates began to slow down, businessmen became wary of making big investments. It was no longer a situation in which competition in a free and expanding market would give everyone the chance to invest and make profits. Rather, corporate houses began to look for special treatment. Some of this happened in legitimate and transparent ways such as, for instance, when they appealed to the government for tax breaks for particular sectors, or relaxation of labour laws to facilitate the outsourcing of labour, or of environmental regulations to open new mines. Other methods were covert and sometimes illegal, such as defaulting on large bank loans without being penalised or arranging for preferential treatment in securing government contracts. In the era of planning and licences, when doing business was a matter of finding your way through a maze of regulations, industrialists had little choice but to seek favours from politicians and bureaucrats. With liberalisation, that era had supposedly come to an end. But from 2010 onwards, a new phase of crony capitalism began in India.




most people seem to make a distinction between corruption as a necessary part of life and corruption as greed. In the first case, one regards oneself as the innocent victim of a system. In the other case, dishonest people try to get rich through corruption: such people must be identified, condemned, and punished.




Medium- and small-size factories and workshops, construction firms, wholesale and retail outlets, agricultural processing, road transport, hotels and restaurants, etc. are sectors that are mainly organised regionally or locally. Needless to say, most of agriculture in most states is carried out by medium and small farmers. All of these groups have to deal mainly with state and local governments. Consequently,




Medium- and small-size factories and workshops, construction firms, wholesale and retail outlets, agricultural processing, road transport, hotels and restaurants, etc. are sectors that are mainly organised regionally or locally. Needless to say, most of agriculture in most states is carried out by medium and small farmers. All of these groups have to deal mainly with state and local governments. Consequently, they involve themselves in state politics to further their interests.




The location of big industries, as I have already explained, earlier depended very much on central policies. But the prospects of regional industry, agriculture, commerce, and services have always had close links with the policies of state governments.




As a rule, entrepreneurial energies are released when there is a social churning that breaks down older hierarchies of property and caste in a regional culture. Most of the states of southern and western India have seen such a churning in the decades after independence. On the other hand, in a state such as West Bengal, the traditional Hindu upper castes consolidated their social and cultural dominance even as they embraced a leftist political ideology. As a result, even with significant land reforms, there has been no regeneration of regional business enterprise in West Bengal. Variations in the social formation of the regional cultures are an important indicator of economic disparities between regions in India.




Here is why. First, the




The Problem with Centralised Power




First, the more power is concentrated at the centre, the greater the relative power of the all-India groups, i.e. corporate business houses and the English-speaking upper middle class.




greater power to the all-India groups necessarily means greater inequality – both between regions and between different sections of the people.




During the period of rapid growth from the late 1990s, new investments in industry came to be concentrated largely in the southern and western states. There were economic reasons for this, having to do with the advantages of geographical location. There were also social and political reasons related to the cultural background of the entrepreneurs and the facilities offered to them by particular state governments. But once the concentration of growth industries increased the prosperity of those regions, average wage rates began to rise and local labour became more and more expensive. What happened then is interesting. Instead of the business houses looking to invest in states where labour was cheap, they took advantage of the fact that, unlike travelling across international borders, labour was free to move all over India. Hence, they employed labour contractors to mobilise migrant workers from poorer states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal to come and work in western and southern India on short-term contracts. Thus, the effects of industrial growth not only remained unequally distributed across regions, the disparities between the developed and less developed regions grew wider.




Even if average incomes rose, the inequality between the top and the bottom rose faster.




Farmers lost their land, and even if they were compensated, they were rarely able to start a new life as successful entrepreneurs, as the official propaganda suggested.




Most of those who moved out of agriculture joined the vast informal sector in towns and cities




the theory propagated by American economists in the 1970s that rapid growth of private capital would create enough wealth in the top layers of society that would gradually trickle down to the bottom layers and make everyone better off. I am told that most economists no longer believe in this fairy tale




The urban upper middle class has a far greater proportion of upper castes than the regional middle classes. As it is, the higher rungs of the private sector have almost no representation from the scheduled castes or tribes. The entry that was allowed to these groups through reservations in the central government services has recently shrunk because recruitment has been greatly reduced. Not only that, lateral entry into these services at middle and higher levels has increased, and the reservations rule does not apply to lateral recruitment which takes place without going through the entry-level competitive examinations.




The second problem with centralised power is that it becomes arbitrary and unaccountable.




Supporters and fans will claim that their leader has powers of intuition that ordinary people lack and so it is best not to try to analyse their decisions too much. This is, of course, a licence for arbitrary power. But those who justify centralised power will claim that the supreme leader must not be hemmed in by rules and procedures.




This is, of course, abandoning entirely the people’s role in a democracy and reducing the people themselves to a passive and obedient mass.




The third problem with centralised authority follows, paradoxically, from what is considered its great strength. Concentration of power in the person of a single leader reduces the focus of all opposition to that person




As a result, opposition politics too will converge on the leader’s person. The regime’s enemies will indeed become the leader’s enemies.




The fourth problem with centralised personal authority is that of succession.




Institutions in such a centralised system become so dependent on the authority of the leader that they fall apart in his or her absence.




When it became independent in 1971, Bangladesh was one of the poorest countries in the world, worse than almost every state in India.




Bangladesh has now almost caught up with the Indian average and that its performance is better than every state in the central and eastern region of India,




Specifically, Bangladesh does better than most Indian states on indicators such as life expectancy, schooling, and gender equality.




This has become possible largely because Bangladesh, instead of trying to introduce high-technology industries that create little employment, has encouraged the spread of innumerable small- and medium-sized workshops, mainly producing garments for export, which employ millions of workers, mostly women. This has resulted in the absorption into the organised labour force of migrants from rural areas, greater economic security of women, and better health and education of women and children.




Of course, Bangladesh being a sovereign nation-state has a different political status from Indian states, but the comparison shows what could be achieved if the poorer Indian states had greater and more flexible decision-making powers to suit their particular conditions.




The constitution had originally declared education a state subject, based on the perfectly good reasoning that education is intimately tied with the language of instruction which varies from state to state. But education was transferred to the concurrent list during the Emergency in 1976 and has remained there ever since.




Initially, the emphasis was mainly on higher education which, it was argued, required a degree of standardisation throughout India.




There is little doubt that centralised power to regulate education has resulted in giving priority to the all-India groups at the expense of the varied needs of the regions and their cultural aspirations.




what is needed is the universalisation of quality bilingual education – in English and an Indian language.




The recent divide between the elite and the regional streams has meant a sharp difference in the quality of education available to the two groups.




English is regionally neutral. To say that it smacks of colonial rule is a silly argument because, as I have shown you, almost every institution and practice of government that we use today is carried over from the days of British rule. Of course, one could still say that English bears the mark of an elite language used by the privileged class. But that is exactly why I am arguing that English should be made available in every school in the country. That would, over time, erase the stamp of elitism which attaches to that language now.




You are well aware of the effort that has been made in Europe to build something like a common economic, cultural, and political structure under the European Union. The task was not easy there because the nations and states of Europe have a long history of bitter warfare among themselves. Yet they have been able to achieve a considerable degree of federal co-operation, even though each member state retains its sovereign status (and Britain has recently exercised that sovereignty to leave the Union). By comparison, India has achieved the constitutional task of federal union far more easily. What it needs to do now is achieve greater economic and social justice by deepening the practice of democracy in every part of the country.




One can, therefore, definitely criticise the Brahmanical claim of superior status by birth and the thoroughly unjust social inequality that claim has perpetuated. But when one ridicules the ritual of tarpaṇ, one forgets that the social life of every community is filled with innumerable imaginary meanings. Even the solidarity of the nation is an imagined idea.

one wants to change the conditions which make religion a tool of oppression, one must also be mindful of how religion makes life more meaningful.




People do not wish to live in the old way. They aspire to something more satisfactory and just. But the changes have come haphazardly, brought by many forces along many channels. There is no coherent sense of direction to the way people are deciding to change their ways of living.




It is in this fluid and confusing social situation that the forces of Hindutva have been able to advance their moral vision of the Hindu Rashtra.




an aggressive cultural effort to project a bellicose version of the Hindu religion which shuns the tenderness and piety of the Bhakti sects and instead projects Ramchandra as a muscular warrior-king with bow and arrow.




Older generations are trying desperately to hold on to their familiar values and are annoyed because the young want something new. They do not see that the Hindutva campaign under Modi has managed to respond to some of the aspirations of the youth all over the country. What the BJP has done is channel those aspirations towards the cause of a militant and intolerant Hindu Rashtra.
