### You Are Not So Smart (McRaney David)


#### 1. Priming

> **THE MISCONCEPTION:** You know when you are being influenced and how it is affecting your behavior.
> 
> **THE TRUTH:** You are unaware of the constant nudging you receive from ideas formed in your unconscious mind.

- You accept your unconscious mind as just another weird component of the human experience, but you tend to see it as a separate thing—a primal self underneath consciousness that doesn’t have the keys to the car. Science has learned otherwise. When a stimulus in the past affects the way you behave and think or the way you perceive another stimulus later on, it is called priming. Reality isn’t a vacuum where you objectively survey your surroundings. You construct reality from minute to minute with memories and emotions orbiting your sensations and cognition; together they form a collage of consciousness that exists only in your skull.

- Priming works best when you are on autopilot, when you aren’t trying to consciously introspect before choosing how to behave. When you are unsure how best to proceed, suggestions bubble up from the deep that are highly tainted by subconscious primes. In addition, your brain hates ambiguity and is willing to take shortcuts to remove it from any situation. If there is nothing else to go on, you will use what is available. When pattern recognition fails, you create patterns of your own.You can’t self-prime, not directly. Priming has to be unconscious; more specifically, it has to happen within what psychologists refer to as the adaptive unconscious—a place largely inaccessible.

- You are always of two minds at any one moment—the higher-level rational self and the lower-level emotional self. The emotional brain is older and thus more evolved than the rational brain. The output is mostly intuition and feeling. It is always there in the background co-processing your mental life. You make the mistake of believing only your rational mind is in control, but your rational mind is usually oblivious to the influence of your unconscious. In this book I add another proposition: You are unaware of how unaware you are. If a situation is familiar you can fall back on intuition. However, if the situation is novel, you will have to boot up your conscious mind. If your behavior is the result of priming, the result of suggestions as to how to behave handed up from the adaptive unconscious, you often invent narratives to explain your feelings and decisions and musings because you aren’t aware of the advice you’ve been given by the mind behind the curtain in your head.

- Much of what you think, feel, do, and believe is, and will continue to be, nudged one way or the other by unconscious primes from words, colors, objects, personalities, and other miscellany infused with meaning either from your personal life or the culture you identify with. You can’t prime yourself directly, but you can create environments conducive to the mental states you wish to achieve.

#### 2. Confabulation

> **THE MISCONCEPTION:** You know when you are lying to yourself.
>
>**THE TRUTH:** You are often ignorant of your motivations and create fictional narratives to explain your decisions, emotions, and history without realizing it.

- It all starts with your brain’s desire to fill in the gaps. Just as the brain fills in your blind spot every moment of the day without your consciously noticing, so do you fill in the blind spots in your memory and your reasoning.The details are missing, but the big picture of your own life persists. But the big picture is a lie, nurtured by your constant and unconscious confabulation, adding up to a story of who you are, what you have done, and why. You are always explaining to yourself the motivations for your actions and the causes to the effects in your life, and you make them up without realizing it when you don’t know the answers. Over time, these explanations become your idea of who you are and your place in the world. They are your self. You are a story you tell yourself. You engage in introspection, and with great confidence you see the history of your life with all the characters and settings—and you at the center as protagonist in the tale of who you are. This is all a great, beautiful confabulation without which you could not function.

- How your mind works is something you can never access, and although you often believe you understand your thoughts and actions, your emotions and motivations, much of the time you do not. The very act of looking inward is already several steps removed from the thoughts you are remembering. This, however, doesn’t prevent you from assuming you really do know, you really can recall in full detail, and this is how narratives begin. This is how confabulation provides a framework from which to understand yourself. In many ways you are only reporting on what your mind has already produced instead of directing its performance.

- For some behaviors, the antecedent is something old and evolved, a predilection passed down through thousands of generations of people like you trying to survive and thrive. You want to take a nap on a rainy afternoon because perhaps your ancestors sought shelter and safety in the same conditions. For other behaviors, the impetus may have come from something you simply didn’t notice. Who you think you are is sort of like a movie based on true events, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The details may be embellished, but the big picture, the general idea, is probably a good story worth hearing about.

#### 3. Confirmation Bias
> **THE MISCONCEPTION:** Your opinions are the result of years of rational, objective analysis.
>
> **THE TRUTH:** Your opinions are the result of years of paying attention to information that confirmed what you believed, while ignoring information that challenged your preconceived notions.

- Confirmation bias is seeing the world through a filter. The real trouble begins when confirmation bias distorts your active pursuit of facts.

- You want to be right about how you see the world, so you seek out information that confirms your beliefs and avoid contradictory evidence and opinions. Over time, by never seeking the antithetical, through accumulating subscriptions to magazines, stacks of books, and hours of television, you can become so confident in your worldview that no one can dissuade you.

- In science, you move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform your opinions as well.

#### 4. Hindsight Bias
> **THE MISCONCEPTION:** After you learn something new, you remember how you were once ignorant or wrong.
>
> **THE TRUTH:** You often look back on the things you’ve just learned and assume you knew them or believed them all along.

- You tend to edit your memories so you don’t seem like such a dimwit when things happen you couldn’t have predicted. When you learn things you wish you had known all along, you go ahead and assume you did know them. This tendency is just part of being a person, and it is called the Hindsight Bias.

- You are always looking back at the person you used to be, always reconstructing the story of your life to better match the person you are today. You have needed to keep a tidy mind to navigate the world ever since you lived in jungles and on savannas. Cluttered minds got bogged down, and the bodies they controlled got eaten. Once you learn from your mistakes, or replace bad info with good, there isn’t much use in retaining the garbage, so you delete it. This deletion of your old, incorrect assumptions de-clutters your mind. Sure, you are lying to yourself, but it’s for a good cause. You take all you know about a topic, all you can conjure up on the spot, and construct a mental model. Hindsight bias is a close relative of the availability heuristic. You tend to believe anecdotes and individual sensational news stories are more representative of the big picture than they are.

#### 5. The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy
>**THE MISCONCEPTION:** You take randomness into account when determining cause and effect.
>
>**THE TRUTH:** You tend to ignore random chance when the results seem meaningful or when you want a random event to have a meaningful cause.

- The fallacy gets its name from imagining a cowboy shooting at a barn. By painting a bull’s-eye over a cluster of bullet holes, the cowboy places artificial order over natural random chance. If you have a human brain, you do this all of the time. Picking out clusters of coincidence is a predictable malfunction of normal human logic. They find a narrative in all the mundane moments, extracting the good bits and tossing aside the rest. This means they can create any orderly story they wish from their reserves of chaos. The powerlessness, the feeling you are defenseless to the whims of chance, can be assuaged by singling out an antagonist. Sometimes you need a bad guy, and the Texas sharpshooter fallacy is one way you can create one. There is a 100 percent chance something will be there, be anywhere, when you look; only the need for meaning changes how you feel about what you see.

- Whenever possible, you oppose the forces of entropy and thwart their relentless derangement. Your drive to do this is primal. You need order. Order makes it easier to be a person, to navigate this sloppy world. For ancient man, pattern recognition led to food and protected people from harm. You are able to read these words because your ancestors recognized patterns and changed their behavior to better acquire food and avoiding becoming it. Evolution has made us into beings looking for clusters where chance events have built up like sand into dunes. You see patterns everywhere, but some of them are formed by chance and mean nothing
