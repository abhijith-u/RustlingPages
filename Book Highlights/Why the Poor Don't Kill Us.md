### Why the Poor Don't Kill Us by Manu Joseph

- It is very cheap to be middle class in India. Because the poor subsidize us all. They force the government and the markets to keep the prices of essentials, including water and electricity, very low, which we consume many times more than the average Indian. But the chief reason why India is a middle-class paradise and why our friends suffer when they go to the West is that the poor serve us for almost nothing.

- As in love, so in society, people who do not have power are quite nice. And in the case of the poor, it is another layer of retardation inflicted on them through very low self-worth.

- In my view, human beings are not intrinsically good or evil. I think they are intrinsically cautious. This caution has the appearance of a virtue, or maybe it really is a virtue. Maybe that is all there is to being humane—a sort of caution. Whatever it is, it is good enough for peace. It is good enough for India’s poor to shun violence or even abhor it. But it is also true that the poor are reined in by powerful forces, like the many leashes of morality, and the promises of hope that the rich have consciously and unconsciously designed to control the poor, to make them fall in line.

- **India’s chaos and ugliness protect us**. Most nations try hard to look richer than they are; India, in plain sight, is a lot poorer than it is in reality. This municipal ugliness of India conveys to the poor that the nation belongs to them, that it has not left them behind. The street chaos and our general civic disorder, too, have the same effect.

- **The poor are the worst enemies of the poor**. The poor do not envy the rich. That notion arises from a common fallacy of how envy works. Envy is a thing between equals. The poor envy others like them who have done better.

- **The absence of human rights for the poor protects us**. What protects us is the brutal side of India. If at all there is anything worse than poverty, it is an Indian jail and to be caught in the Indian judicial system for criminal activity. It is a deadly deterrent. What India cannot do with competent legal systems, it accomplishes in informal ways.

- **Vulgarity is also hope**. This is what intellectuals didn’t get about the richest Indian Mukesh Ambani (and American intellectuals did not understand about Donald Trump). People, today, aspire to money and not class. They admire money, even if it is on other people. There is a sort of vulgarity that is dangerous in a poor country, but there is an aspirational quality to some kinds of vulgarity.

- **The false hope of higher education**. The poor, who wish to make something of the lives of their children, are sucked into the powerful idea of education. Their lives do become somewhat better because the modern economic system is rigged to favour the educated. As a result, the poor play a game where the elite hold all the cards.

- Every revolution is created and sponsored by the second rung of the elite to trounce their oppressor, nominally in the interest of things like equality and fairness. The wars against capitalism, inequality, dictatorship, and men are primarily the wars of the top 2 per cent against the top 1 per cent, with everyone else enlisted in the cause of the second rung. This is true even of the Indian freedom movement. Most of the icons of the Indian freedom movement were from the highest caste, relegated to a social rung below the British. We can frame the freedom movement as the aristocrat’s use of morality to mobilize the masses and defeat his oppressor.

- The miserable are not as miserable as we think. Can it be that the poor, too, are fine and that they may even be happy? After all, an unsung cause of human happiness is low standards. For friends, for the spouse, for the nation. Maybe, just like some people find misery in everything, most people are programmed to find joy in their lives no matter what. Maybe, the poor are not as miserable as we fear. The persistence of happiness, the inevitability of happiness, maybe that, too, protects us.


- The low standards for the poor are embedded in all the cures that India prescribes for poverty. It begins in the faulty middle-class academic conjecture of what the poor want. Every Indian who is not poor is, inescapably, a poverty-eradication thinker. His insurmountable problem is finding a competent authority to whom to delegate this task.


Almost every concrete and abstract thing in India is influenced by the poor. India’s elite in every field are deeply influenced and shaped by the poor. India’s poverty gives Indians a clear moral direction. Every affluent Indian may or may not have a moral compass, but certainly has one for India, and it directs the country to end poverty. How to go about it is at the heart of all our economic, social, and political debates.


Despite this attitude towards the poor and poverty by the better off, or perhaps because of it, we are, in many ways, a vulgar nation.


Often, vulgarity itself has no consequence for us. We can’t help some of it, but still the fact is that there is a kind of vulgarity that is a form of disrespect of an unlucky person.


Everyone finds someone else vulgar. For example, the Indian middle class find billionaires vulgar. Extravagant


The urban middle class does not employ the poor merely to cook for them, drive them, and walk their dogs, but also to be used as moral pedestals to stand on and accuse billionaires that they are ‘too vulgar in a poor country’. But then, do India’s vast poor make a serious distinction between the billionaires, the centi-millionaires, the multi-millionaires, the mere millionaires, the asset-millionaires, the soon-to-inherit- dad’s-house millionaires, and the rest of the top 1 per cent?


Also, what is the show of wealth the poor actually see? To them it is the middle class that is the most visible section of ‘the rich’. Because the ionosphere of the super-rich is beyond what their eyes can see. (This is what commentators missed in the aftermath of ‘demonetization’ when they did not see its political popularity—they


The classy think their wealth is hidden from plain sight, but there are things that are not invisible to the poor. In fact, class reminds them of both wealth and alien culture, the reason why class is politically more despicable than son-of-the-soil wealth.


The average voter despises the articulate global intellectual; so much that even when the intellectual talks sense, the voter hates sense itself. From this faultline flows a stream of politics.


poor. There was a time when the Indian middle class behaved like the poor


but today we behave more like the rich.


There are millions of Indians who feel they are poor. So far, they have revolted against us through politics. But in the future there will be other ways. The provocations are there, every day.


What use is all the landscaping, when the poor come in a pall of visual poverty? And, because of mobile phones, they are not only seen but also heard— laughing, crying, fighting, loving. They also hog the meagre private resources of a community whose nation gives them nothing in the way of beauty. This is a nation where the middle class pays a premium not for the quality of things but to ensure the other kind of Indians are not allowed entry.


The rich keep talking about how they subsidize the poor. They do. But it is also a fact that the poor subsidize our lifestyles by supplying labour cheaper than in much of the world. Also, every layer of Indian society subsidizes the lifestyle of the layer above by working for exploitatively low wages.


The sleeping pill of the 80s became, in the 90s, Art of Living classes and the philosophies of men who said, ‘I am you and you are me’, yet wore fancy dress costumes to distinguish themselves from you and me. They mined a myth Indians were trained from birth to believe—that we had an innate spiritual power that no one else possessed, some great ancient secret that the West came seeking. Every now and then, a public figure would speak of the unhappy West and our joyful poor.


Chapter 4 HOW INDIA’ S CHAOS AND UGLINESS REASSURE THE POOR


THERE is a difference in the circumstances of European nobodies and Indian nobodies. In Western Europe, the nobodies are in ghettos of abject failure surrounded by a mainstream society that is, in plain sight, happy and thriving.


In a rich country, those who consider themselves poor feel that the nation has left them behind. Their poverty always has a human villain.


The Indian nobodies see a very different world. They, of course, see the glitter of the rich, the decadence of the young in long cars, and the illuminated fine-dining behind glass windows, but it is the rich who are in their cages, and it is the classy who are confused about their idea of home. Most of the nation belongs to the nobodies; it is a republic of nobodies.


Poverty is not only an economic condition; it is a very distinct line of human behaviour. In poverty is the heritage of us all.


and D. The IITs were never great centres of learning by world standards. Rather, they were museums that collected young Indians with excellent quantitative abilities.


The new IITians are trained to crush an exam. They were told that was what they had to do to liberate themselves from their bleak lives, and they worked in inhuman ways to achieve that. But they are not bright in other ways, in ways the generations before them were—that is, bright in an urbane, globalized, anglicized way.


This is a classic case of co-option: The elite promote a way of life in which they are highly adept as the best way to be; in effect, they tell others what the elite are actually always saying without realizing it: ‘why can’t you be like us’; the poor then do everything they can to imitate the elite but they fall short because there are aspects of living that cannot be imitated, aspects of parenting and cultural marination that cannot be aped; the poor then become grotesque versions of their elite; the elite then migrate or are displaced from their strongholds, and move on to what is considered prestigious by people they discreetly consider superior to them (like white people), and their former strongholds, which they have vacated, are now filled by the lower-middle class and the poor, diminishing the lure of the very things that were once prestigious.


This pursuit of higher education that promises to convert millions into clerks plays a part in taming the disenchantments of those who were not lucky enough to be born in the right homes. This was how the previous generations of the almost-poor were tamed. In fact, this was how all of the Indian middle class was tamed by the British. It was not a collateral effect of some colonial plan. Instead, that was the plan, it appears—to tame Indians by making them clerks.


Nehru then went on to invest an impoverished nation’s meagre resources in higher education for the elite instead of going for universal primary education. (Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen, in their book, An Uncertain Glory, use this fact to argue that newly independent India was not ‘socialist’ as most Indians think, because socialist nations, for all their faults, invested heavily in primary education, health of women and children, and other aspects of equality, something that Kerala alone did.)


All of the modern Indian middle class is a creation of a wilful or unintended subjugation of intellectual spirit. Layers and layers of social and economic classes that strive to rise are, and will be, subsumed by a civilization-sized pressure to ‘study’ for the dullest reason why humans ever choose to study—to receive a salary.


What Nehruvians call the aspirations of the poor are in reality co-option by the rich. The poor, especially the smart, are always co-opted into systems where the rich hold all the cards.


It would be unspeakably foolish to think that knowledge is meant for the rich alone.


But if they are doing it just to get a degree, respectability, or prolonged hostel accommodation, then it is a very expensive mistake.


Without the lottery of success, the lives of humanities students from poor families are fragile.


India is rigged in such a way that apart from sports, the only other sphere where the talented poor can do well is politics.


Oh yes, education is about acquiring knowledge. That’s wonderful for those who really want that. The most humane reform modern India can make is to ensure that a college degree is not a qualification for non-technical or non-scientific jobs, or even for any aptitude test, including the civil services exam. A written test and a series of job interviews are not a perfect assessment of a human, but still a far superior form of ascertaining a person’s abilities than a piece of paper about him. In fact, for jobs that do not require preloaded technical knowledge, it should be made illegal for corporations and other organizations to demand a college degree, because a degree is a form of economic and social discrimination.


Also, the poor are conned by prestige. The nature of prestige is such that it ceases to exist when the poor demonstrate that they can achieve it. That is why the refined affluent who express their concern for the poor students of JNU do not send their own children there. Instead, they will buy them an unsurpassable education in the US. Shouldn’t everyone who believes in equality deny their own children a huge head start?


Almost all Indians got into college because they filled an application form and their parents paid their entire fees. And most emerged from college with no special skill or knowledge.


Across the world, the poor and the lower-middle classes despise poor migrants (for convenience I will use the word ‘migrants’ to refer to ‘immigrants’ too) because poor migrants first compete for resources and jobs with poor residents and not editorial writers and development economists. A central quality of an immigrant is that he is competition, or perceived as competition. If you are not in competition with a migrant, you are analysing the wrong migrant. Find the migrant who is your rival and you will suddenly realize you are not so noble any more.


The hatred for the potent migrant is very severe among the poor locals of a region because they undercut their wages, bring in more of their own, and form a tight community that makes them an even more formidable job market. And, of course, the migrant is usually a bit poorer than the local poor.


our primary protection, the thing that really guards us, is something else, something ancient maybe. It is not exactly noble, which is also why it works.


What protects us, to the extent that it can, is the brutal side of India. If at all there is anything worse than poverty, it is an Indian jail and the Indian judicial system. It is a deadly deterrent even for criminals. India exacts a very heavy price for hurting its upper classes.


The killings are not the worst thing that the cops can do to a person. The poor who are caught face torture. Many rot away in hellish jails without a trial for years. What India cannot do with competent legal systems, it accomplishes in informal ways.


But this way of keeping us safe has a flaw. It is a flaw that is present in all security systems, and not just the criminality of police. The flaw is that its primary use to us is as a deterrent, and a deterrent is only useful against rational criminals. And there are people who are not rational.


Religious and other cultural identities are not ‘useless’ as such but in a poor country they are primarily the domains of the upper classes. How, then, have they transmitted this disease of identity so easily down the classes?


Some powerful forces are at play apart from the most obvious element, which is that the upper classes have a disproportionate control over storytelling. The fundamental nature of stories and storytellers, too, are responsible.


This is why politics is the way it is, and why democracy itself is doomed in the long run. The most captivating stories are not necessarily true, nor what will make our lives better. People ‘identify’ with stories not out of wisdom or clarity but impelled by that highly influential force—misunderstanding. Clarity is often inconvenient, while misunderstanding is a pleasurable massage of prejudice. For when we misunderstand something, we attribute to what we get wrong all that we want it to be.


Far more important is the nature of storytellers. The effectiveness of a good storyteller does not emerge from virtues like sanity, sobriety, clarity, stability, or that complex but useful thing, compassion. The insane, the melancholic, the bitter, the enraged, and the innately melodramatic tell the best stories. They are too good for more sober or moral storytellers who try to win people over through common sense, say through the promise of better infrastructure, schools, and hospitals.


why can’t the space programme coexist with the eradication of malaria? Should a nation wait to kill all its mosquitoes before it sends metal into space? But then, considering the fact that rocket science is easier than eradicating poverty or malaria, we arrive at the very reason why societies do some sexy things—to hide the fact that they cannot achieve difficult things. All of the exotic issues of Indian politics exist not because Indians so love their culture. They exist because it is easier to demolish a mosque or build a temple than it is to enforce standardized intelligent road design across the nation.


Also, the fact that Indians have finally managed to love India, but they don’t really love other Indians.


the history of other nations should teach us that nationalism always begins as dangerous pride but slowly becomes something more genuine in the form of true love for a nation, and when that happens, pride is replaced by shame, a national shame for all its flaws. And people then solve their difficult problems. But I have withdrawn that opinion. I am unable to hold that view any more, watching India struggle with the issue of quality of life and mask all its failures in bullshit.


The ‘left’ is a low-stakes human hive of hearts that sees the world as a human hive of victims. The ‘right’ is a high-stakes preoccupation with what is locally relevant. The ‘left’ is a monoculture of a European idea; the ‘right’ is culture.


Politicians are usually wealthy themselves but their identity is not that of rich men. They are provincial strongmen, rustic headmen, chieftains, the central foes of the classy. Also, their corruption and their ill-gotten wealth is evidence that they are useful men, especially to a person who is dependent on the state. They are, culturally, closer to the poor than intellectuals, humanitarians, and other kinds of activists can ever be. They are more relatable to the poor than even fabulous poor writers can ever


The Indian voter backs a corrupt politician because the rogue gets things done for him, at least in the short term.


All of India’s political, economic, and spiritual history is proof that when the poor and the rich have the same ideas, it means the rich have co-opted the poor.


Across the millennia that Christianity spanned in Europe, moneylending was a disgraceful act and even punished with execution. Around 1515, a German called Jakob Fugger, who is regarded the richest man who ever lived by some estimations, changed this. He bribed Pope Leo, who legitimized profiting from moneylending. To be precise, the pope legitimized lending that involved ‘labour, cost or risk’. There is no human activity that does not involve at least one of these three qualities. In this way, Fugger and the corrupt pope may have set the foundations of Western capitalism. The Christian rehabilitation of moneylending did not last very long (a future pope would reverse Leo’s order). In any case, despite the backing of a corrupt pope, the stigma never really left the profession of moneylending.


Moral ideas like the importance of family, sacrifice, culture, religion, nation, and the idea that a community is more important than an individual, are ideas that primarily favour the rich but they are enticing to the poor who wish to emulate or imitate the rich. The rich who think these ideas are tricks to control the poor usually fail. The rich who believe in these ideas and whose own lives are hard evidence that they believe in these ideas are the truly powerful transmitters of social morals that restrain the poor from overturning the order. The self-interest of a merchant is beneficial to society. But the feudal act of direct intervention through charity is not only useful to the poor, its optics also protect the rich. Austerity is not a trick. It is a form of intelligence. The state of wealthiness is not a caste; being posh is a caste. The poor despise symbols of money far less than symbols of class.


Comedians like to appear serious because they don’t want to be trivialized as clowns. This mechanism is also the reason why companies that are constantly criticized for being unethical, even when they are not particularly so, are inclined to project themselves through hyper-morality. Mining and oil and gas companies show excessive and not entirely dishonest concern for nature the way Apple Inc. does not. And people who do not have a talent for natural goodness, try to make exaggerated guesses about what being good might be—they are the wokes. Most good people are just those who are afraid of being seen as bad.


Articulation of the conscience is a beautiful invention of the intellectual class. This expression is not chicanery; there is something deeply honest about it. Yet its primary function is to let words and confessions and good thoughts compensate for hard sacrifice.


Austerity is possible only when one is able to afford everything it rejects. And what it rejects is most of the useless products that capitalism creates for the super- rich.


There is something honest about extravagance as an expression, but it creates considerable ill will.


The austere are not playing a game. They want to be this way, they cannot be any other way. Culturally, religiously, psychologically they are compelled not to be extravagant. Very simply, they believe in austerity. And through this belief they inadvertently make their wealth a bit more palatable for the poor.


The true character of a new town is never in the ‘new’ part; it is in the nature of its original population.


Actual Gurugram, which is erroneously known as Old Gurgaon, emerged from a pastoral way of life and is even today rustic, and mindful of caste and religion. It has a history of communal tension, and is also one of the worst regions in India for women.


the fundamental nature of the place is the nature of its original people; it is rural Haryana. Even Mumbai could not pretend for long that it was anything more than a Maharashtrian town.


One of the great civil wars of our times is the battle between the idea of the village and the idea of city; the battle between roots and rootlessness. It is a battle that the village is winning everywhere. In this victory are the signs of peace between the classes that are culturally similar.


the very existence of Indian athletes of global calibre is not because of India, but in spite of India.


the most thrilling aspect of Indian athletes who triumph at the Olympics is that they are so exceptional that despite everything India threw at them, they have reached so far. The middle class opts out of this sporting torment and instead becomes a consumer of national pride through the efforts of the poorer people. Like they employ drivers and gardeners, they also employ the poor to overcome the realities of India and somehow triumph against other nations.


Across this nation, hundreds of millions of people use sheer grit to overcome everything India throws at them in their quest to make something of their lives.


We extol the virtues of extraordinary people who have achieved extraordinary things through sheer grit. But most gritty people may have nothing to show for all their grit. I believe that just making a go of it in a hostile nation like India as an ordinary person is great in itself. That is why lucky Indians should be melodramatically kind to the unlucky. In this, excesso is better. Even in this there could be self-interest at play. Visible acts of kindness of a society are underrated in keeping it safe.


Any form of economic behaviour is usually not rational, it is merely a habit. That is the reason why in many societies, people tip only waiters but not other professionals who perform as much or far greater service. Like shop assistants.


How does a society come up with an idea like inheritance tax when it is against the rich, which includes politicians and other powerful people? How does society bring in reforms when powerful people stand to lose from change? Why do good things happen in India?


The reformation of society can be explained without giving too much credit to reformers. Society changes when the second rung of social power takes on the most powerful. Usually, this second rung is the old elite. When they become the underclass in a new world, they try to restore the balance of power through a moral cause, chiefly in the name of the poor. It works.


What can hurt the modern monarch more than the society taking away half of what they planned to bequeath to their genetic material?


Across the ages, all of activism is just this—the second rung of a society fighting against the top rung in the name of a public cause.


Symmetric Schismogenesis. In this phenomenon, people assume the opposite views of their rivals and then take these views to the extremes simply to differ from the other camp. Most people do not have strong beliefs. They arrive at them by developing the exact opposite views of those they despise. This is the reason why intellectuals find it hard to transmit wisdom. The problem is never that people are too dumb to see wisdom. As I have argued elsewhere in the book, people dislike wisdom if they dislike the mouth it comes from.


The people they despise are their preachy colleagues, nasty bosses, acquaintances. And spouses, who are the most underrated counter- influencers. Many political ideas of ordinary men and women are shaped by their dislike for their spouses. All mainstream ideas have a point. They have to be moral, otherwise they would not have survived infancy to go mainstream. Morality is the tax an idea has to pay to survive.


Thus, the idea that reform occurs because some people who are better than us transform society is one of our most stupid. Generally, activists are pawns in a complex game between the elites, or pawns of their own ordinary evil that they do not fully realize.


WHAT is the relevance of ‘good guys’ who always lose? What is the purpose of people who stand for harmony, equality, and freedom, but cannot draw the support of citizens who also want harmony, equality, and freedom? What is the point of an activist who speaks to the masses when the masses do the exact opposite of what he asks them to do? In a democracy, what is the meaning of public rejection? Over the past decade, strongmen have trounced humanitarians. How should we view the people who have been fighting the strongmen?


They are conservationists of a society’s best qualities; they ensure that just because some virtues are not popular any more, they do not slide further into oblivion. It is a voice that can emerge only from defeat. But shouldn’t human virtues have better champions, people who know how to defeat the practical types? Not only do the ‘good guys’, especially in India, not know how to win, they also do not retire; they persist in their doomed fight because they have nothing else to do and they ensure that more talented activists with more potent fights in them do not rise.


Such voices of lament,


convey to the poor that their concerns matter, that society, despite everything, has ‘a moral compass’.


The whole spectrum of India’s poor, which in this context includes the lower-middle classes, decide Indian politics and, to an extent, Indian politics is the revenge of the poor. They have consistently voted in second-rate people for short-term gains and to control rival castes and Muslims. In that way, the poor do kill. They may harm themselves more or as much as they harm the upper-middle class in creating a political class that has created a largely unenjoyable modern nation, but that does not alter the fact that something of this hell is a result of spite, the spite that the average Indian feels for those who are richer than him.


In fact, India’s rich and half-rich may feel sheepish about freely expressing even their half gloom, their mild depressions, the way the affluent in other nations can. India’s threshold for what constitutes misery is very high. Even in this golden age of self-absorption, you feel it is somewhat indecent to lament your reasonless gloom without a deep sociological or medical reason.


In response to their failure to fix the country, the Indian upper class has always resorted to migration. Not just by leaving India. The rich flee India even within, by creating islands of comfort and safety that the other India encroaches upon only as maids, drivers, delivery boys, and GST. That is more or less what Gurugram’s residential real estate boom is about.


In the best areas of London or New York, you pay a premium for what the city offers, and what the city offers is available to everyone. In India, it is the opposite. The city is the problem, and you pay to shut it out, along with most Indians of your ilk.


When affluent Indians pay for a home or lifestyle, they do not pay for the value of the thing but for the promise that India cannot enter it, at least not easily. It’s not just homes, but also schools, resorts, restaurants, and even cinemas that are in reality clubs that keep the real India out.


The upper-middle class does spend a lot of money on its cocoons but it has also developed ways of exclusion that cost nothing or very little. They use what is called ‘culture’ and a bit of sophistication to exclude most Indians from their daily lives.


The objective of any family, whatever be its resources, is to provide an unfair advantage to its children.


The mechanism of greed can increase the general quality of life but cannot fix inequality because the whole point of greed is inequality. Do-gooding is inefficient because it attracts exactly those people who are useless in solving anything; the modern history of India is living proof.
