### The ABCs of Socialism

#### Isn’t America already kind of socialist? (Chris Maisano)

*****

con-f l ating all government action with socialism forces us to defend many of the most objec-tionable forms of state activity, including

*****

those that we would want to abolish in a free and just society.

*****

It’s one thing to identify public libraries with socialism. They operate according to democratic principles of access and distribution, providing services to all regardless of one’s ability to pay. They would be one of the most important insti-tutions in any socialist society worthy of the name. But it’s quite another to include the police

*****

Government spending on social pro-grams and other activities may well increase in the coming decades because of the aging population, the climate crisis, and other developments. But the sheer volume of spending tells us little about the political valence of government action. Key ques-tions about that state activity always need to be asked: does it reinforce or undermine the power of those who own capital? Does it increase our subordination to market discipline or of f er us more freedom from its demands?

*****

many of the biggest pro-grams over the last few decades do nothing to strengthen the power of workers.

*****

Why does this happen? For one thing, the rich and powerful invest heavily in political activity to promote their inter-ests and block progressive reforms.

*****

The middle and upper classes also hold the most important posts in government, elected and appointed alike. They share a common set of ideas and values predicated on protecting the status quo and repressing any major challenge to that system, partic-ularly those that come from the working class and the Left.

*****

The tax revenues or debt fi nancing governments rely on are directly related to the state of the capitalist economy and its rates of growth and prof i tability. If the level of economic activity declines — perhaps, because capitalists are unhappy about new Isn’t

*****

legislation that benef i ts workers — the state will fi nd it increasingly dif f i cult to fund its activities. This in turn leads to a decline in its legitimacy and its level of popular support.

*****

Often, if capitalists aren’t induced to make investments through business subsidies and other incentives, they simply will refuse to invest.

*****

It’s also how they’re able to conf l ate their own interests with a larger “public” or “national” interest — under a capitalist system, there’s some truth to their claim.

*****

So long as the funda-mental structures of the economy remain unchanged, state action will dispropor-tionately benef i t capitalist interests at the expense of everything else.

*****

Simply electing politicians to of f i ce or watching the government expand by its own momentum has never been, and never will be, enough. Economic power is political power, and under capitalism the owners of capital will always have the capacity to undermine popular democracy

*****

Winning government power and using it to break the dominance of the capitalist class is a necessary condition for beginning the transition to socialism.

*****

The bitter experiences of the twentieth century have taught us that socialism won’t further the cause of human freedom if the political and administrative struc-tures of government aren’t thoroughly democratized.
In the absence of popular organization and militancy, government action will do little to shift the balance of power away from capital and toward labor.
Isn’t America already kind of socialist?

*****

In order to withstand the inevitable backlash from capitalist and conservative forces, a socialist transition would need to draw on mass popular sup-port and direct participation in the af f airs of government.

*****

Only under these conditions would government activity be synonymous with democratic socialism

*****

No, socialism isn’t just more government — it’s about democratic ownership and control.

#### But at least capitalism is free and democratic, right? (Erik Olin Wright)

*****

many take for granted that freedom and democracy are inextri-cably connected with capitalism.

*****

To say that capitalism restricts the fl our-ishing of these values is not to argue that capitalism has run counter to freedom and democracy in every instance. Rather, through the functioning of its most basic processes, capitalism generates severe def i -cits of both freedom and democracy that it can never remedy.

*****

At the core of these values is self- determination: the belief that people should be able to decide the conditions of their own lives to the fullest extent pos-sible. When an action by a person af f ects only that person, then he or she ought to be able to engage in that activity without asking permission from anyone else. This is the context of freedom. But when an action af f ects the lives of others, then these other people should have a say in the activity. 
This is the context of democracy. In both, the paramount concern is that people retain as much control as possible over the shape their lives will take.

*****

What we need, therefore, is a set of rules to distinguish between questions of freedom and those of democracy. In our society, such a distinction is usually made with reference to the boundary between the private and public spheres.

*****

it is forged and maintained by social processes

*****

The state vigorously enforces some public/private boundaries and leaves others to be upheld or dissolved as social norms. Often the boundary between the public and the private remains fuzzy.

*****

Capitalism constructs the boundary between the public and private spheres in a way that constrains the realization of true individual freedom and reduces the scope of meaningful democracy. There are fi ve ways in which this is readily apparent.

*****

1. “Work or Starve” Isn’t Freedom

*****

It is also the ability to act posi-tively on one’s life plans — to choose not just an answer, but the question itself.
--
It = Freedom

*****

Poverty in the midst of plenty exists because of a direct equa-tion between material resources and the resources needed for self-determination.

*****

2. Capitalists Decide

*****

The way the boundary between the public and private spheres is drawn in capitalism But at least capitalism is free and democratic, right?
9534 In the Name of Love Miya Tokumitsu • Jacobin • Issue 13

*****

excludes crucial decisions, which af f ect large numbers of people, from democratic control.

*****

Even if one argues that this concentration of power in private hands is necessary for the ef f i cient allocation of resources, the exclusion of these kinds of decisions from democratic control unequivocally decimates the capacity for self-determination by all except the owners of capital.

*****

3. Nine to Five Is Tyranny

*****

An essential component of a business owner’s power is the right to tell employees what to do. That is the basis of the employment contract:

*****

autonomy is given or withheld at the owner’s pleasure.

*****

4. Governments Have to Serve the Interests of Private Capitalists

*****

Private control over major investment decisions creates a constant pressure on public authorities to enact rules favorable to the interests of capitalists.

*****

Democratic values are hollow so long as one class of citizens takes priority over all others.

*****

5. Elites Control the Political System

*****

is not only wealthy individuals, but also capitalist corporations, that face no meaningful restriction on their

*****

ability to deploy private resources for polit-ical purposes. This dif f erential access to political power voids the most basic prin-ciple of democracy.

*****

● ● ●

*****

When the political conditions are right, the anti-democratic and freedom-impeding features of capitalism can be palliated, but they cannot be eliminated. Taming capitalism in this way has been the cen-tral objective of the policies advocated by socialists within capitalist economies the world over.
But if freedom and democracy are to be fully realized, capitalism must not merely be tamed. It must be overcome.

*****

It might seem that way, but genuine freedom and democracy aren’t compatible with capitalism

#### Socialism sounds good in theory, but doesn’t human nature make it impossible to realize? (Adaner Usmani & Bhaskar Sunkara)

*****

People are complex: they do unspeakable things, but they also engage in remarkable acts of kindness and, even in dif f i cult situations, show deep regard for others.

*****

For at least two reasons, socialists are committed to the view that all humans share some important interests. The fi rst is a moral one.

*****

Our outrage that individuals are denied the right to live free and full lives is anchored in the idea that people are inherently cre-ative and curious, and that capitalism too often stif l es these qualities.

*****

Having a conception of human nature also helps us make sense of the world around us. And by helping us to interpret the world, it aids our ef f orts to change it, as well.
--
2nd reason

*****

Resistance to exploitation and oppression is a constant throughout history — it is as much a part of human nature as competitiveness, or greed. The world around us is fi lled with instances of people defending their lives and dignity.

*****

Of course, the history of all “hitherto existing society” is also a record of passivity and even acquiescence. Mass collective action against exploitation and oppres-sion is rare. If humans everywhere are committed to defending their individual interests, why don’t we resist more?

*****

Under ordinary circumstances, the risks associated with acting collectively often seem overwhelming.

*****

Collective action requires many dif f erent individuals to decide to take these risks together, so it’s not surprising that it is uncommon and mostly fl eeting.

*****

Put dif f erently, socialists don’t believe that the absence of mass movements is a sign that people have no inherent desire to fi ght back, or worse, that they don’t even recognize what their interests are. Rather, protest is uncommon because people are smart. They know that in the present polit-ical moment change is a risky, distant hope, so they develop other strategies to get by.

*****

one of our prin-cipal tasks as socialists is to support these movements, to help make collective action a viable choice for even more people.

*****

In this ef f ort — and the struggle to def i ne the values of a more just society — we will be aided, not hurt, by our shared nature. ■ 23847 The

Our shared nature actually helps us build and def i ne the values of a more just society.

#### Don’t the rich deserve to keep most of their money? (Michael A. McCarthy)

*****

the socialist justif i cation for taxes is grounded in a view — not often captured in opinion polls — about how capitalist wealth is actually created.

*****

Tax policy does two things in capitalist society. First, it determines what share of the total economic pie will be managed by the public, in the form of government revenue, and how much will be left to the use of private actors like individuals and corporations. Second, it stipulates how that public share is divvied up between the competing needs and wants of individuals, organizations, and corporations. The fi rst is about resource control while the second is a matter of allocation.

*****

Even when a government takes in high tax revenue, it does not necessarily put it to progressive ends. Just consider the huge benef i ts that fl ow to corporations through subsidies or state-supported research and development, and it’s easy to see how gov-ernments can redistribute up, down, or horizontally.

*****

In a capitalist economy, where productive resources remain privately owned, socialists call for a signif i cant por-tion of the social product to be controlled publicly and democratically redistributed downward.

*****

But socialists should not fall back on the common liberal criterion for taxation: that a person or corporation’s ability to pay should

*****

determine the amount they pay.

*****

The socialist view of redistribution within a capitalist society must reject an important premise at play in nearly all tax policy debates: that pre-tax income is some-thing earned solely by individual ef f ort and possessed privately before the state inter-venes to take a part of it. Once we break from this libertarian fantasy, it’s easy to see that individual and corporate income is made possible only through tax-f i nanced state action.

*****

The capitalist economy is not self- regulating. The fi rst precondition for fi rms to earn prof i ts is state-enforced property rights, which give some people ownership and control over productive resources while excluding others. Second, governments

*****

have to manage labor markets to help ensure that the skill needs of fi rms are met. States do this through setting immigration and education policies.

*****

Third, most capitalists want states to enforce anti-trust, contract, criminal, property, and tort laws, as it makes market interactions more predictable and reliable. And fi nally, the capitalist economy needs a working infra-structure. Even most libertarians argue that state control over the money supply and interest rates is necessary to spur or slow growth when the economy needs it.

*****

All of this is done with taxes. I

*****

A person’s income or a corporation’s prof i ts are in part the result of governments collecting taxes and actively creating the conditions under which they were able to make money in the fi rst place.

*****

The socialist case for taxation and pro-gressive redistribution is built from three basic factors of how capitalism works. First, as just explored, personal incomes and corporate prof i ts are not simply the result of individual work and business competi-tion — instead they are part of a broader social product.

*****

Second, the class inequality that results from making this social product

*****

is relational. Capitalists are able to accu-mulate large stores of wealth only because workers do not. All things being equal, fi rms can raise their prof i ts in inverse proportion to the labor costs they bear

*****

Taxation provides a partial remedy to that essential, structural inequality of capitalist society.

*****

Third, redistribution through taxation is a means of extending individual freedom — not curtailing it,

*****

On one side, there is negative freedom, the absence of coercion or “freedom from” that is the hallmark of most common con-ceptions of freedom

*****

taxes fund a variety of public provisions that of f er cit-izens some measure of freedom from the private tyranny of fi rms

*****

In the context of tax policy, however, positive freedom matters as well. Positive freedom is the “ability to” — the capacity to do things, and the possibility of selecting goals and making ef f orts to realize them. 
Such freedom requires resources.

*****

The public education system, for example, which of f ers citizens the opportunity to develop knowl-edge and skills in pursuit of both collective

*****

and individual ambitions, is a bedrock of positive freedom that can only be sustained through taxation.

*****

In a truly socialist society, the combi-nation of political and economic equality would of f er everyone a far greater degree of both negative and positive freedom than they enjoy under capitalism. Until we realize that world, progressive redis-tribution through taxation is both a means to redress structural inequalities and the primary way we can expand and extend freedom to as many people as possible.

*****

Wealth is socially created — redistribution just allows more people to enjoy the fruits of their labor.
