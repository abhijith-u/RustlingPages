The ABCs of Socialism

Isn’t America already kind of socialist?

*****

con-f l ating all government action with socialism forces us to defend many of the most objec-tionable forms of state activity, including

*****

those that we would want to abolish in a free and just society.

*****

It’s one thing to identify public libraries with socialism. They operate according to democratic principles of access and distribution, providing services to all regardless of one’s ability to pay. They would be one of the most important insti-tutions in any socialist society worthy of the name. But it’s quite another to include the police

*****

Government spending on social pro-grams and other activities may well increase in the coming decades because of the aging population, the climate crisis, and other developments. But the sheer volume of spending tells us little about the political valence of government action. Key ques-tions about that state activity always need to be asked: does it reinforce or undermine the power of those who own capital? Does it increase our subordination to market discipline or of f er us more freedom from its demands?

*****

many of the biggest pro-grams over the last few decades do nothing to strengthen the power of workers.

*****

Why does this happen? For one thing, the rich and powerful invest heavily in political activity to promote their inter-ests and block progressive reforms.

*****

The middle and upper classes also hold the most important posts in government, elected and appointed alike. They share a common set of ideas and values predicated on protecting the status quo and repressing any major challenge to that system, partic-ularly those that come from the working class and the Left.

The tax revenues or debt fi nancing governments rely on are directly related to the state of the capitalist economy and its rates of growth and prof i tability. If the level of economic activity declines — perhaps, because capitalists are unhappy about new Isn’t

legislation that benef i ts workers — the state will fi nd it increasingly dif f i cult to fund its activities. This in turn leads to a decline in its legitimacy and its level of popular support.

*****

Often, if capitalists aren’t induced to make investments through business subsidies and other incentives, they simply will refuse to invest.

*****

It’s also how they’re able to conf l ate their own interests with a larger “public” or “national” interest — under a capitalist system, there’s some truth to their claim.

*****

So long as the funda-mental structures of the economy remain unchanged, state action will dispropor-tionately benef i t capitalist interests at the expense of everything else.

*****

Simply electing politicians to of f i ce or watching the government expand by its own momentum has never been, and never will be, enough. Economic power is political power, and under capitalism the owners of capital will always have the capacity to undermine popular democracy

*****

Winning government power and using it to break the dominance of the capitalist class is a necessary condition for beginning the transition to socialism.

*****

The bitter experiences of the twentieth century have taught us that socialism won’t further the cause of human freedom if the political and administrative struc-tures of government aren’t thoroughly democratized.
In the absence of popular organization and militancy, government action will do little to shift the balance of power away from capital and toward labor.

*****

In order to withstand the inevitable backlash from capitalist and conservative forces, a socialist transition would need to draw on mass popular sup-port and direct participation in the af f airs of government.

*****

Only under these conditions would government activity be synonymous with democratic socialism

*****

No, socialism isn’t just more government — it’s about democratic ownership and control.
