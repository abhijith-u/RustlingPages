### The ABCs of Socialism

#### Isn’t America already kind of socialist? (Chris Maisano)

* Conflating all government action with socialism forces us to defend many of the most objectionable forms of state activity, those that we would want to abolish in a free and just society. It’s one thing to identify public libraries with socialism. They operate according to democratic principles of access and distribution, providing services to all regardless of one’s ability to pay. They would be one of the most important institutions in any socialist society worthy of the name. But it’s quite another to include the police.

 
- Government spending on social programs and other activities may well increase in the coming decades because of the aging population, the climate crisis, and other developments. But the sheer volume of spending tells us little about the political valence of government action. Key questions about that state activity always need to be asked: does it reinforce or undermine the power of those who own capital? Does it increase our subordination to market discipline or offer us more freedom from its demands?

- Many of the biggest programs over the last few decades do nothing to strengthen the power of workers. Why does this happen? For one thing, the rich and powerful invest heavily in political activity to promote their interests and block progressive reforms. The middle and upper classes also hold the most important posts in government, elected and appointed alike. They share a common set of ideas and values predicated on protecting the status quo and repressing any major challenge to that system, particularly those that come from the working class and the Left.

  
- The tax revenues or debt financing governments rely on are directly related to the state of the capitalist economy and its rates of growth and profitability. If the level of economic activity declines — perhaps, because capitalists are unhappy about new legislation that benefits workers — the state will find it increasingly difficult to fund its activities. This in turn leads to a decline in its legitimacy and its level of popular support.

    Often, if capitalists aren’t induced to make investments through business subsidies and other incentives, they simply will refuse to invest. It’s also how they’re able to conflate their own interests with a larger “public” or “national” interest — under a capitalist system, there’s some truth to their claim.

    So long as the fundamental structures of the economy remain unchanged, state action will disproportionately benefit capitalist interests at the expense of everything else.

  

- Simply electing politicians to office or watching the government expand by its own momentum has never been, and never will be, enough. Economic power is political power, and under capitalism the owners of capital will always have the capacity to undermine popular democracy. Winning government power and using it to break the dominance of the capitalist class is a necessary condition for beginning the transition to socialism.

    The bitter experiences of the twentieth century have taught us that socialism won’t further the cause of human freedom if the political and administrative structures of government aren’t thoroughly democratized. In the absence of popular organization and militancy, government action will do little to shift the balance of power away from capital and toward labor.

    In order to withstand the inevitable backlash from capitalist and conservative forces, a socialist transition would need to draw on mass popular sup-port and direct participation in the af f airs of government. Only under these conditions would government activity be synonymous with democratic socialism

  
**No, socialism isn’t just more government — it’s about democratic ownership and control.**

#### But at least capitalism is free and democratic, right? (Erik Olin Wright)

  
- Many take for granted that freedom and democracy are inextricably connected with capitalism. To say that capitalism restricts the flourishing of these values is not to argue that capitalism has run counter to freedom and democracy in every instance. Rather, through the functioning of its most basic processes, capitalism generates severe deficits of both freedom and democracy that it can never remedy.

- At the core of these values is self-determination: the belief that people should be able to decide the conditions of their own lives to the fullest extent possible. When an action by a person affects only that person, then he or she ought to be able to engage in that activity without asking permission from anyone else. This is the context of _freedom_. But when an action affects the lives of others, then these other people should have a say in the activity. 
This is the context of _democracy_. In both, the paramount concern is that people retain as much control as possible over the shape their lives will take.

    What we need, therefore, is a set of rules to distinguish between questions of freedom and those of democracy. In our society, such a distinction is usually made with reference to the boundary between the private and public spheres. It is forged and maintained by social processes. The state vigorously enforces some public/private boundaries and leaves others to be upheld or dissolved as social norms. Often the boundary between the public and the private remains fuzzy.

- Capitalism constructs the boundary between the public and private spheres in a way that constrains the realization of true individual freedom and reduces the scope of meaningful democracy. There are five ways in which this is readily apparent.

     1. _“Work or Starve” Isn’t Freedom._ It is also the ability to act positively on one’s life plans — to choose not just an answer, but the question itself. Poverty in the midst of plenty exists because of a direct equation between material resources and the resources needed for self-determination.

      2. _Capitalists Decide._ The way the boundary between the public and private spheres is drawn in capitalism excludes crucial decisions, which affect large numbers of people, from democratic control. Even if one argues that this concentration of power in private hands is necessary for the efficient allocation of resources, the exclusion of these kinds of decisions from democratic control unequivocally decimates the capacity for self-determination by all except the owners of capital.

      3. _Nine to Five Is Tyranny._ An essential component of a business owner’s power is the right to tell employees what to do. That is the basis of the employment contract. Autonomy is given or withheld at the owner’s pleasure.

      4. _Governments Have to Serve the Interests of Private Capitalists._ Private control over major investment decisions creates a constant pressure on public authorities to enact rules favorable to the interests of capitalists. Democratic values are hollow so long as one class of citizens takes priority over all others.

    5. _Elites Control the Political System._ It is not only wealthy individuals, but also capitalist corporations, that face no meaningful restriction on their ability to deploy private resources for political purposes. This differential access to political power voids the most basic principle of democracy.

  
- When the political conditions are right, the anti-democratic and freedom-impeding features of capitalism can be palliated, but they cannot be eliminated. Taming capitalism in this way has been the central objective of the policies advocated by socialists within capitalist economies the world over. But if freedom and democracy are to be fully realized, capitalism must not merely be tamed. It must be overcome.

**It might seem that way, but genuine freedom and democracy aren’t compatible with capitalism**

#### Socialism sounds good in theory, but doesn’t human nature make it impossible to realize? (Adaner Usmani & Bhaskar Sunkara)

- People are complex: they do unspeakable things, but they also engage in remarkable acts of kindness and, even in difficult situations, show deep regard for others. For at least two reasons, socialists are committed to the view that all humans share some important interests.
    - The first is a moral one. Our outrage that individuals are denied the right to live free and full lives is anchored in the idea that people are inherently creative and curious, and that capitalism too often stifles these qualities. 
    - The second reason is that having a conception of human nature also helps us make sense of the world around us. And by helping us to interpret the world, it aids our efforts to change it, as well. 

- Resistance to exploitation and oppression is a constant throughout history — it is as much a part of human nature as competitiveness, or greed. The world around us is filled with instances of people defending their lives and dignity.

    Of course, the history of all “hitherto existing society” is also a record of passivity and even acquiescence. Mass collective action against exploitation and oppression is rare. If humans everywhere are committed to defending their individual interests, why don’t we resist more?

     Under ordinary circumstances, the risks associated with acting collectively often seem overwhelming. Collective action requires many different individuals to decide to take these risks together, so it’s not surprising that it is uncommon and mostly fleeting. Put differently, socialists don’t believe that the absence of mass movements is a sign that people have no inherent desire to fight back, or worse, that they don’t even recognize what their interests are. Rather, protest is uncommon because people are smart. They know that in the present political moment change is a risky, distant hope, so they develop other strategies to get by.

    One of our principal tasks as socialists is to support these movements, to help make collective action a viable choice for even more people. In this effort — and the struggle to define the values of a more just society — we will be aided, not hurt, by our shared nature.

  
**Our shared nature actually helps us build and define the values of a more just society.**

#### Don’t the rich deserve to keep most of their money? (Michael A. McCarthy)

 
- The socialist justification for taxes is grounded in a view — not often captured in opinion polls — about how capitalist wealth is actually created. Tax policy does two things in capitalist society. 

    - First, it determines what share of the total economic pie will be managed by the public, in the form of government revenue, and how much will be left to the use of private actors like individuals and corporations.
    - Second, it stipulates how that public share is divvied up between the competing needs and wants of individuals, organizations, and corporations.
 
    The first is about resource control while the second is a matter of allocation.

  
- Even when a government takes in high tax revenue, it does not necessarily put it to progressive ends. Just consider the huge benefits that flow to corporations through subsidies or state-supported research and development, and it’s easy to see how governments can redistribute up, down, or horizontally.

- In a capitalist economy, where productive resources remain privately owned, socialists call for a significant portion of the social product to be controlled publicly and democratically redistributed downward. But socialists should not fall back on the common liberal criterion for taxation: that a person or corporation’s ability to pay should determine the amount they pay.

- The socialist view of redistribution within a capitalist society must reject an important premise at play in nearly all tax policy debates: that pre-tax income is some-thing earned solely by individual effort and possessed privately before the state intervenes to take a part of it. Once we break from this libertarian fantasy, it’s easy to see that individual and corporate income is made possible only through tax-financed state action.

- The capitalist economy is not self-regulating. The first precondition for firms to earn profits is state-enforced property rights, which give some people ownership and control over productive resources while excluding others.

    Second, governments have to manage labor markets to help ensure that the skill needs of firms are met. States do this through setting immigration and education policies.

    Third, most capitalists want states to enforce anti-trust, contract, criminal, property, and tort laws, as it makes market interactions more predictable and reliable.
    
    And finally, the capitalist economy needs a working infrastructure. Even most libertarians argue that state control over the money supply and interest rates is necessary to spur or slow growth when the economy needs it.

    **All of this is done with taxes.** A person’s income or a corporation’s profits are in part the result of governments collecting taxes and actively creating the conditions under which they were able to make money in the first place.

  
- The socialist case for taxation and progressive redistribution is built from three basic factors of how capitalism works. First, as just explored, personal incomes and corporate profits are not simply the result of individual work and business competition — instead they are part of a broader social product.

    Second, the class inequality that results from making this social product is relational. Capitalists are able to accumulate large stores of wealth only because workers do not. All things being equal, firms can raise their profits in inverse proportion to the labor costs they bear. Taxation provides a partial remedy to that essential, structural inequality of capitalist society.

    Third, redistribution through taxation is a means of extending individual freedom — not curtailing it.
    - On one side, there is **negative freedom**, the absence of coercion or “freedom from” that is the hallmark of most common con-ceptions of freedom. Taxes fund a variety of public provisions that offer citizens some measure of freedom from the private tyranny of frms.
    - In the context of tax policy, however, **positive freedom** matters as well. Positive freedom is the “ability to” — the capacity to do things, and the possibility of selecting goals and making efforts to realize them. Such freedom requires resources. The public education system, for example, which offers citizens the opportunity to develop knowl-edge and skills in pursuit of both collective and individual ambitions, is a bedrock of positive freedom that can only be sustained through taxation.

    In a truly socialist society, the combination of political and economic equality would offer everyone a far greater degree of both negative and positive freedom than they enjoy under capitalism. Until we realize that world, progressive redistribution through taxation is both a means to redress structural inequalities and the primary way we can expand and extend freedom to as many people as possible.

  
**Wealth is socially created — redistribution just allows more people to enjoy the fruits of their labor.**

#### Will socialists take my Kenny Loggins records? (Bhaskar Sunkara)

  
- Socialists simply don’t want a world without personal property — the things meant for individual consumption. Instead, socialists strive for a society without private property — the things that give the people who own them power over those who don’t.

- Exploitation is not unique to capitalism. It’s around in any class society, and simply means that some people are compelled to labor under the direction of, and for the benefit of, others. Battles won by labor movements to limit the scope and intensity of exploitation only ever mitigated in capitalism, never eliminated. That persistent difference between what you produce and what you get back in return is exploitation — a key source of profits and wealth in capitalism.

- Radically changing things would mean taking away the source of capitalists’ power: the private ownership of property. That’s the socialist vision: abolishing private ownership of the things we all need and use — factories, banks, offices, natural resources, utilities, communication and transportation infrastructure — and replacing it with social ownership, thereby undercutting the power of elites to hoard wealth and power. And that’s also the ethical appeal of socialism: a world where people don’t try to control others for personal gain, but instead cooperate so that everyone can flourish.

**Socialists want a world without private property, not personal property.**

#### Doesn’t socialism always end up in dictatorship? (Joseph M. Schwartz)

- Socialism, of all stripes, was conflated with the crimes of the Soviet Union and doomed to the trash heap of bad ideas. Yet many socialists were consistent opponents of authoritarianism of both left and right varieties. Marx himself understood that only by the power of their democratic numbers could workers create a socialist society.

- Despite the common assertion that “capitalism equals democracy,” capitalists themselves, absent the pressure from an organized working class, have never supported democratic reforms.

- While criticizing capitalism as anti-democratic, democratic socialists consistently opposed authoritarian governments that claim to be socialist. Revolutionaries such as Rosa Luxemburg and Victor Serge criticized early Soviet rule for banning opposition parties, eliminating experiments in workplace democracy, and failing to embrace political pluralism and civil liberties. If the state owns the means of production, the question remains: how democratic is the state? 

    As Luxemburg wrote in her 1918 pamphlet on the Russian Revolution:
    > Without general elections, without freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, without the free battle of opinions, life in every public institution withers away, becomes a car-icature of itself, and bureaucracy rises as the only deciding factor.

  
- Corporations are forms of hierarchical dictatorships, as those who work in them have no voice in how they produce, what they produce, and how the profit they create is utilized. 

- Democratizing a complex economy would likely take a variety of institutional forms, ranging from worker ownership and cooperatives, to state ownership of fi nancial institutions and natural monopolies (such as telecommunications and energy) — as well as international regulation of labor and environmental standards. The overall structure of the economy would be determined through democratic politics and not by state bureaucrats. But the question remains: how to move beyond capitalist oligarchy to socialist democracy?

- By the late 1970s, French and Swedish capital invested abroad instead of at home, creating a recession that halted the promising moves toward democratic socialism. The policies of Thatcher and Reagan, which ushered in over thirty years of de-unionization and cuts to the safety net, confirmed the Left’s prediction that either socialists would move beyond the welfare state to democratic control over capital or capitalist power would erode the gains of postwar social democracy.

    Today, socialists across the world face the daunting challenge of how to rebuild working-class political power strong enough to defeat the consensus of both conservatives and Third Way social democrats in favor of corporate-dictated austerity.

- In many ways, one-party Communist states shared more in common with past authoritarian capitalist “developmentalist” states — such as late nineteenth-century Prussia and Japan, and postwar South Korea and Taiwan — than with the vision of democratic socialism. These governments prioritized state-led industrialization over democratic rights, particularly those of an independent labor movement.

    Neither Marx nor classic European socialism anticipated that revolutionary socialist parties might most readily seize power in predominantly agrarian, auto-cratic societies. In part, these parties were based in a nascent working class radicalized by the exploitation of foreign capital. The Marxist tradition had little to say about how predominantly agrarian and postcolonial societies could develop in an equitable and democratic manner. What history does tell us is that trying to force peasants who had just been given private land by Communist revolutionaries back onto collective state farms results in brutal civil wars that sets back economic development for decades.

- Contemporary economic reforms in China, Vietnam, and Cuba favor a mixed-market economy with a significant role for foreign capital and private land-owning peasants. But one-party elites instituting these experiments in economic pluralism have almost always repressed advocates of political pluralism, civil liberties, and labor rights.

    Of course, there also exists a rich history of experiments in democratic socialism in the developing world. But the United States government and global capitalist interests consistently work to undermine even these modest efforts at economic democracy. For students of history, the question should be not whether socialism necessarily leads to dictatorship, but whether a revived socialist movement can overcome the oligarchic and anti-democratic nature of capitalism.

  

**Socialism is often conflated with authoritarianism. But historically, socialists have been among democracy’s staunchest advocates**

#### Is socialism a Western concept? (Nivedita Majumdar)

  
- Within the Left itself, there is suspicion of an ideal many view as single-mindedly focused on economic issues and distant from other everyday sufferings, especially those of black and brown people. The underlying assumption in these related lines of attack is that socialism, a supposedly Western (and white) ideology, while capable of addressing economic injustices, remains incapable of speaking to the lived experience of oppression and discrimination in the Global South, as well as oppressed groups elsewhere.

  
- The laws of the market, whatever the claims of neoclassical economics, are not fair or impartial. The superior economic and political might of capital ensures that the market’s laws are always fixed in its favor. Against all odds, workers invariably fight back. But it’s always an agonizing battle, with capital using every weapon in its arsenal to crush workers’ resistance. The bosses’ crude methods include physical intimidation when they can get away with it, as in Bangladesh, and more polished gambits, like closing down entire stores, as in the United States.

    This is a specific kind of dehumanization, born of deprivation and powerlessness and familiar to workers in every part of the world, who are forced to choose between their livelihood and their safety. Socialism identifies the source of such dehumanization — private ownership and exploitation — and rejects it.
  
- Socialism is not Eurocentric because the logic of capital is universal — and so is resistance against it. Cultural specificities may shape some details of capital’s operation differently in the United States and in Bangladesh, in France and in Nicaragua, but they do not alter its fundamental prioritization of profits over people.

    The crime of capitalism is that it forces the vast majority of the population to remain preoccupied with basic concerns of nutrition, housing, health, and skill acquisition. It leaves little time for fostering the community and creativity that humans crave.

    Capitalism does not merely oppress workers on the factory floor. It creates an entire culture in which the logic of oppression and competition become common sense. It turns people against each other and their own humanity. There is nothing Eurocentric in rejecting the destructive logic of capital and fighting for a better world to replace it.

  

**Socialism is not Eurocentric because the logic of capital is universal — and so is resistance against it.**

#### What about racism? Don’t socialists only care about class (Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor)

- By every barometer in American society — health care, education, employment, poverty — African Americans are worse off. Elected officials from across the political spectrum often blame these disparities on an absence of “personal responsibility” or view them as a cultural phenomenon particular to African Americans. In reality, racial inequality has been largely produced by government policy and private institutions that not only impov-erish African Americans but also demonize and criminalize them.

- Crafting better public policy and banning discriminatory behavior by individuals or institutions won’t do the job. And while there is a serious need for government action banning practices that harm entire groups of people, these strategies fail to grasp the scale and depth of racial in- equality in the United States.

- Divide and Rule : Because of the gross inequality it pro-duces, capitalism relies on various political, social, and ideological tools to rationalize that inequality while simultaneously dividing the majority, who have every interest in uniting to resist it. Racism is only one among many oppressions intended to serve this purpose. The central objective was preserving the institution of slavery and the enormous riches that it produced.

    As Karl Marx recognized,
    > Direct slavery is just as much the pivot of bourgeois industry as machinery, credits, etc.

- The literal dehumanization of Africans for the sake of labor was used to justify their harsh treatment and their debased status in the United States. This dehumanization did not simply end when slavery was abolished. The debasement of blacks also made African Americans more vulnerable to economic coercion and manipulation — not just “anti-blackness.” Coercion and manipulation were rooted in the evolving economic demands of capital, but their impact rippled far beyond the economic realm.

- African Americans were so thoroughly banished from political, civil, and social life that it was virtually impossible for the vast majority of poor and working-class whites to even conceive of uniting with blacks to challenge the rule and authority of the ruling white clique.

    Marx grasped the modern dynamics of racism as the means by which workers who had common objective interests could also become mortal enemies because of subjective — but nevertheless real — racist and nationalist ideas. This antagonism is artificially kept alive and intensified by the press, the pulpit, the comic papers, in short by all the means at the disposal of the ruling classes. This antagonism is the secret of the impotence of the English working class, despite its organization. It is the secret by which the capitalist maintains its power. And that class is fully aware of it.

  
- Within the socialist tradition, many have also argued that because African Americans and most other nonwhites are disproportionately poor and working class, campaigns aimed at ending eco-nomic inequality alone would stop their oppression.

    This stance ignores how racism constitutes its own basis for oppression for nonwhite people. Ordinary blacks and other nonwhite minorities are oppressed not only because of their poverty but also because of their racial or ethnic identities.
There is also no direct correlation between economic expansion or improved economic conditions and a decrease in racial inequality. In reality, racial discrim-ination often prevents African Americans and others from fully accessing the fruits of economic expansion. Looking at racism as only a byproduct of economic inequality ignores the ways that racism exists as an independent force that wreaks havoc in the lives of all African Americans.

- Antiracist struggles also take place in response to the social crises black com-munities experience, including struggles against racial prof i ling; police brutality; housing, health care, and educational inequality; and mass incarceration and other aspects of the “criminal justice” system. Unity cannot be achieved by suggesting that black people should downplay the role of racism in our society so as not to alienate whites — while only focusing on the “more important” struggle against economic inequality.

    This is why multiracial groupings of socialists have always participated in strug-gles against racism. Violent conflict between working-class blacks and whites underlined the extent to which racial division destroyed the bonds of solidarity necessary to collectively challenge employers, landlords, and elected officials.


**We actually think that the struggle against racism is central to undoing the ruling class’s power.**

The ABCs of Socialism

Aren’t socialism and feminism sometimes in conf l ict?

*****

Nicole Aschof f

*****

Socialists are often accused of overem-phasizing class — of placing the structural divide between those who must work for a wage to survive and those who own the means of production at the center of every analysis. Even worse they ignore or underplay how central other factors — like sexism, racism, or homophobia — are in shaping hierarchies of power. Or they admit the importance of these negative norms and practices, but argue that they can be rooted out only after we get rid of capitalism.

*****

They accuse mainstream feminists of aligning themselves with bourgeois polit-ical projects that diminish the agency of working women or pushing middle-class demands that ignore the needs and desires

*****

of poor women, both in the global north and south.

*****

Muddying the waters further is how the politics of feminism is complicated by the historical nature of capitalism — the way sexism is integrated into both processes of prof i t making and the reproduction of the capitalist system as a whole is dynamic.

*****

Why Socialists Should Be Feminists

*****

Women outperform men in higher edu-cation but they don’t achieve comparable levels of success or wealth and remain ste-reotyped and under-represented in the popular media.

*****

Pay gaps are matched by a gendered division of labor. The retail, service, and food sectors — the center of new job growth — are dominated by women, and the feminization of “care” work is even more pronounced.

*****

Disproportionate numbers of caring jobs are low-paying, contingent gigs in which humiliation, harassment, assault, and wage theft are common.

*****

Sexism also plays a less obvious, but critical, role in prof i t-making. From the beginning, capitalism has relied on unpaid labor outside the labor market (mainly in the home) that provides the essen-tial ingredient for capital accumulation: 
workers — who must be created, clothed, fed, socialized, and loved. 
This unpaid labor is highly gendered.

*****

In this way, women are doubly oppressed — exploited in the work-place and unrecognized as workers in the social reproduction of labor.

*****

Why Feminists Should Be Socialists

*****

These persistent, cross-class gender divides — in the political, economic, and social spheres — fuel the dominant feminist viewpoint that sexism is a thing apart from capitalism, something that must be tackled separately.

*****

Today, mainstream femi-nists gravitate toward a focus on putting women in power — both in the political and economic sphere — as a way to solve the range of problems women face,

*****

The emphasis on individual advance-ment as the path to achieving the goals of feminism is not new, and has been cri-tiqued by numerous feminists

*****

who question the notion of sisterly solidarity as a remedy for deep-seated gender divides.

*****

These class ten-sions bleed into feminist politics, as middle-class feminist advocates claim to represent working-class women.

*****

Capital feeds on existing norms of sexism, compounding the exploitative nature of wage work. When women’s ambitions and desires are silenced or under-valued, they are easier to take advantage of. Sexism is

*****

part of the company toolkit, enabling fi rms to pay women less — particularly women of color — and otherwise discriminate against them.

*****

It is important and necessary that women step into positions of power, but this won’t change the fundamental divide between workers and owners — between women at the top and women at the bottom.

*****

Taking class seriously means anchoring the oppression of women within the material conditions in which they live and work while recognizing the role of sexism in shaping both women’s work-life and their home life.

*****

In the past, women have made the biggest gains by fighting for both women’s rights and workers’ rights simultaneously — linking the fi ght against sexism to the fi ght against capital.

*****

Trade union women created a new fi eld of possibility by demanding not only higher wages and equal opportunity but also child-care, fl exible work schedules, pregnancy leave, and other gains usually overlooked or undervalued by their union brothers.

*****

This is the direction that both socialists and feminists should be orienting them-selves — toward struggles and demands that challenge both the drives of capital and the ingrained norms of sexism that are so deeply rooted under capitalism.

*****

the struggle for single-payer health care

*****

free higher education, free childcare, and a universal basic income combined with a robust social safety net.
These reforms would lay the groundwork for more radical goals that would go far in rooting out sexism, exploitation, and the commodif i cation of social life.

*****

Ultimately the goals of radical feminism and socialism are the same — justice and equality for all people, not simply equal opportunity for women or equal partici-pation by women in an unjust system.

*****

Wouldn’t a more democratic world just mean a bigger environmental crisis?

*****

Alyssa Battistoni

*****

Capitalism is wreaking havoc on the world we live in.

*****

The most harmful ef f ects, of course, are falling on the world’s poorest people.

*****

Human activity has transformed the entire planet in ways that are now threatening the way we inhabit it — some of us far more than others.

*****

It’s true that the USSR’s environmental record doesn’t inspire much conf i dence. 
But that doesn’t mean that capitalism can solve our environmental problems, as bright-green entrepreneurs declare, or that modern industrial society must be abandoned altogether, as some deep greens would have it.

*****

Yet the twentieth-century socialist dream of maximizing production in the pursuit of abundance and equality seems increasingly untenable. Marxists held that communism would arise amid post- capitalist conditions of superabundance: 
once the capitalist engines were roaring, they could be seized and put to the benef i t

*****

of all. But those engines can’t run on fossil fuels any more, and contemporary con-sumer capitalism isn’t the abundance we had in mind. We need not only to seize the means of production, but to transform them.

*****

Environmental leftism of late has tended towards an anarchist bent that’s distrustful of large-scale produc-tion and concentrated power, whether private or public. This shouldn’t be sur-prising — because environmental problems are so place-specif i c, they often prompt small-scale local solutions. But climate change and other environmental crises arising from global systems of production and consumption are systemic issues of political economy; addressing them will require more than just pockets of alterna-tive practice. And environmental problems don’t respect political borders: ecological interdependence is another reminder that sustainability will come only through global solidarity.

*****

While some socialists aspire to a super-abundance of everything for everyone, environmentalists tend to point to over-consumption as a primary culprit of environmental degradation. But not all con-sumption is equivalent

*****

The goal of a socialist society is not to clamp down on popular consumption, but to create a society that emphasizes quality of life over quantity of things.

*****

Instead of an endless cycle of working and shopping, life in a low-carbon socialist future would be oriented around activities that make life beautiful and ful-filling but require less intensive resource consumption

*****

a host of current technologies, from clean energy sources to biotechnologies, promise to be part of a more sustainable future. But as long as they’re privately controlled, produced

*****

only when profitable, and accessible only to those who can pay, their potential will be exploited only as it serves capitalists. 
A socialist society would support research into problems whose solutions aren’t profit-able and ensure that resulting technologies are put to use for public benefit.

*****

A socialist society would make deci-sions about producing and implementing

*****

new technologies based on democratically chosen aims, rather than producing and consuming wastefully in order to keep var-ious industries profitable.

*****

We could pay the costs of minimizing environmental damage rather than cutting corners to beat the competition.

*****

Collective ownership of the means of production should include common own-ership of the land, oceans, and atmospher

*****

That would mean not only sharing in the resources that those spaces generate, but deciding together how they should be used.

*****

That world will need forests as well as factories, wilderness refuges as well as cities.

*****

Under socialism, we would make decisions about resource use democratically, with regard to human needs and values rather than maximizing profit.

*****

Are socialists pacifists? 
Aren’t some wars justified?

Jonah Birch

In each country it was the rich who had declared war and stood to profit from it; but it was the poor who were sent to fight and die by the millions.

*****

The master class has had all to gain and nothing to lose,

while the subject class has had nothing to gain and all to lose — especially their lives.”

*****

Making the World Safe for Capitalism

*****

In the organization of state violence on an unprecedented scale, we see capitalism’s tendency to subordi-nate human need to the logic of profit and power.

*****

Capital-ists in countries like the United States still rely on their own government’s military, both to enforce the “rules of the game” in the global economy and to help them com-pete more effectively against other ruling classes.

*****

Against this state of affairs, socialists support the organization of mass move-ments against the wars waged by our government.

*****

Over the past century and a half, the American state has waged brutal wars on behalf of a growing empire, from the 1898 Spanish-American War to the recent invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. It has intervened again and again in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to protect the interests

*****

of business and stamp out movements that might threaten its control over key resources or undermine the global capitalist system’s stability.

*****

Given the scope and scale of American imperial violence, it’s crucial that socialists in the United States oppose their govern-ment’s military interventions. Such a stance is necessary for any genuine working-class solidarity.

*****

To the extent that Americans buy into the nationalism that inevitably goes along with their government’s machina-tions abroad, they make the emergence of a class-based movement against oppression and exploitation impossible.

The Enemy at Home

*****

However, if socialists in a country like the United States are opposed to the wars fought by their governments, that does not mean they are pacifists

*****

The question is who is waging the war and on behalf of what interests or policies.

*****

As the nineteenth-century military the-orist Carl von Clausewitz noted, “War is a continuation of politics by other means.”

*****

in a world filled with exploitation and oppression, one has to differentiate between the violence of those fighting to maintain injustice, and those fighting against injustice.

*****

For the socialist movement, Clausewitz’s dictum points to the need to assess any war on the basis of the interests it serves. It’s no coincidence that socialists like Marx and Engels supported the Union in the Civil War, recognizing that

*****

a war against the Confederacy would necessarily become a war against the planter class.

*****

we can never hope to match the capacity for violence of the capitalist state, and our movement will only be weakened insofar as the struggle for socialism is transformed from a social and political conflict into a military one.
Nor are we necessarily supportive of gov-ernments just because they happen to be in conflict with our own: we do not excuse the imperial violence of, for instance, Russia and China simply because they are occa-sionally at loggerheads with our own rulers.

*****

while expressing solidarity with movements challenging oppression, socialists must be willing to criticize those waging these struggles, whenever necessary — whether that criti-cism is made on political, strategic, or even moral grounds.

*****

On that basis, we hope to forge an internationalist movement that can not only challenge a particular imperial inter-vention, but can come to pose a threat to the very foundations of a system that breeds war and mass violence on a scale unprecedented in history.

*****

Socialists want to eradicate war because it is brutal and irrational. But we think there’s a difference between the violence of the oppressed and that of the oppressors.

*****

Why do socialists talk so much about workers?

*****

the most common response is a moral one — socialists think that workers suffer the most under capitalism, making their plight the most important issue to focus on.

*****

But if this is all there is to it, if this is the only reason we should focus on class, the argument falls apart pretty easily. After all, there are lots of groups who suffer indignities and injus-tices — racial minorities, women, the disabled. Why single out workers? Why not just say that every marginal and oppressed group ought to be at the heart of socialist strategy?
Yet there is more to the focus on class than just the moral argument. The reason

*****

socialists believe that class organizing has to be at the center of a viable political strategy also has to do with two other prac-tical factors: a diagnosis of what the sources of injustice are in modern society, and a prognosis of what are the best levers for change in a more progressive direction.

*****

Capitalism Won’t Deliver

*****

two items are abso-lutely essential. The first is some guarantee of material security — things like having an income, housing, and basic health care. The second is being free of social domination — if you are under someone else’s control, if they make many of the key decisions for you, then you are constantly vulnerable to abuse.

*****

Capitalism is an economic system that depends on depriving the vast majority of people of these essential preconditions for a decent life.

*****

This is not some incidental or marginal aspect

*****

of capitalism. It is the defining feature of the system.

*****

Holding the Lever

*****

It follows that the first step to making our society more humane and fair is to reduce the insecurity and material deprivation

*****

But we imme-diately run into a problem — the political resistance of elites.

*****

What this means is that progres-sive reform efforts have to find a source of leverage, a source of power that will enable them to overcome the resistance of the cap-italist class and its political functionaries.

*****

The working class has this power, for a simple reason — capitalists can only make their profits if workers show up to work every day, and if they refuse to play along, the profits dry up overnight.

*****

Actions like strikes don’t just have the potential to bring particular capitalists to their knees, they can have an impact far beyond, on layer after layer of other insti-tutions that directly or indirectly depend on them — including the government. This ability to crash the entire system, just by refusing to work, gives workers a kind of leverage that no other group in society has, except capitalists themselves.

*****

Workers are therefore not only a social group that is systematically oppressed and exploited in modern society, they are also the group that is best positioned to enact real change and extract concessions from the major center of power — the bankers and industrialists who run the system

*****

Any movement that extended benefits to the poor, whether they were black or white, male or female, had to base itself on a mobilization of working people.

*****

Workers are at the heart of the capitalist system. 
And that’s why they are at the center of socialist politics.

Will socialism be boring?

Danny Katch

Socialism has often been portrayed in science fiction in these types of gray dystopian terms, which reflect the ambiv-alence that many artists have toward capitalism. Artists are often repulsed by the anti-human values and commercial-ized culture of their society, but they are also aware that they have a unique status within it that allows them to express their creative individuality — as long as it sells. 
They fear that socialism would strip them of that status and reduce them to the level of mere workers, because they are unable to imagine a world that values and encourages the artistic expression of all of its members.

*****

Does it really matter if socialism is boring? Perhaps it seems silly, even offen-sive, to be concerned about such a trivial matter compared to the horrors that cap-italism inflicts all the time.

*****

We like watching movies about the end of the world or people facing adver-sity, but in our actual lives most of us prefer predictability and routine.

*****

But it does matter, of course, because we don’t want to live in a society without creativity and excitement, and also because if those things are being stifled then there must be a certain ruling clique or class that is doing the stifling — whether or not they think it’s for our own good. Finally, if socialism is stale and static, it will never be able to replace capitalism, which can accurately be called many nasty things, but boring is not one of them.

*****

Capitalism can reinvent itself far more quickly than any previous economic order. “Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form,” write Marx and Engels in The Communist Man-ifesto, is “the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninter-rupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the capitalist epoch from all earlier ones.” While earlier class societies desperately tried to maintain the status quo, capitalism thrives on overturning it.

*****

Outside of work, it’s the same story. Schools see their primary role as providing “career readiness,” which is an inoffensive phrase that means getting kids prepared to handle the bullshit of work

*****

Most of us only experience the excite-ment of capitalism as something happening somewhere else: new gadgets for rich people, wild parties for celebrities, amazing performances to watch from your couch.

*****

Adding insult to injury, we are then told if we complain that we are standing in the way of progress.

*****

The sacrifice of individuals in the name of societal progress is said to be one of

*****

the horrors of socialism, a world run by faceless bureaucrats supposedly acting for the common good. But there are plenty of invisible and unelected decision-makers under capitalism, from health insurance officials who don’t know us but can deter-mine whether our surgery is “necessary” to billionaire-funded foundations that declare schools they have never visited to be “failures.”

*****

Socialism also involves plenty of change, upheaval, and even chaos, but this chaos, as Hal Draper might have said, comes from below.

*****

first steps toward socialism offered both the promise of creation and the threat of destruction, but with the crucial difference that the people Trotsky wrote about were playing an active role in determining how their world was changing.

*****

the years between the October Revolution and Stalin’s final consolidation of power demonstrated the excitement of a society in which new doors are open to the majority classes for the first time.

*****

Socialism didn’t find talented Will socialism be boring?

*****

artists to be a threat to “equality” or find a contradiction between appreciating indi-vidual artists and opening up the previously elitist art world to the masses of workers and peasants.

*****

And the society they were pointing toward was a place where equality meant not lowering but raising the overall cultural and intellectual level of society.

*****

Most of them imagine societies without conflict, which is why they seem so creepy — including the ones intending to promote socialism.

*****

A similar problem exists inside many protest movements today, in which some activists want to organize movements and meetings around a consensus model, which means that almost everybody present has to agree on a decision for it to get passed. 
Consensus can sometimes be an effective way to build trust among people who don’t know and trust one another, especially because most people in this supposedly

*****

democratic society have almost no expe-rience participating in the democratic process of discussion, debate, and then a majority-rule vote.
When organizers view consensus not only as a temporary tactic but as a model for how society should be run, however, there is a problem. I want to live in a democratic society with conflicts and arguments, where people aren’t afraid to stand up for what they believe in and don’t feel pressured to soften their opinions so that, when a com-promise is reached, we can pretend that we all agreed in the first place. If your case for socialism rests on the idea that people will stop getting into arguments and even occasionally acting like jerks, you should probably find another cause.

*****

To be an effective socialist, it is extremely helpful to like human beings. Not humanity as a concept but real, sweaty people.

*****

Loving the public but not people is also a feature of elitist socialists, whose faith rests more on five-year development plans, utopian blueprints, or winning future elec-tions than on the wonders that hundreds of millions can achieve when they are inspired and liberated. That is why their visions for socialism are so lifeless and unimaginative.
By contrast, Marx, who is often pre-sented as an isolated intellectual, was a rowdy, argumentative, funny, passionate person who once declared that his favorite saying was the maxim: “I am a human being, I consider nothing that is human alien to me.” I find it hard to see how a world run by the majority of human beings, with all of our gloriously and infuriatingly different talents, personalities, madnesses, and pas-sions, could possibly be boring.

*****

Socialism isn’t about inducing bland mediocrity. It’s about unleashing the creative potential of all.
