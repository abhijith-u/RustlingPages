### The ABCs of Socialism

#### Isn’t America already kind of socialist? (Chris Maisano)

*****

con-f l ating all government action with socialism forces us to defend many of the most objec-tionable forms of state activity, including

*****

those that we would want to abolish in a free and just society.

*****

It’s one thing to identify public libraries with socialism. They operate according to democratic principles of access and distribution, providing services to all regardless of one’s ability to pay. They would be one of the most important insti-tutions in any socialist society worthy of the name. But it’s quite another to include the police

*****

Government spending on social pro-grams and other activities may well increase in the coming decades because of the aging population, the climate crisis, and other developments. But the sheer volume of spending tells us little about the political valence of government action. Key ques-tions about that state activity always need to be asked: does it reinforce or undermine the power of those who own capital? Does it increase our subordination to market discipline or of f er us more freedom from its demands?

*****

many of the biggest pro-grams over the last few decades do nothing to strengthen the power of workers.

*****

Why does this happen? For one thing, the rich and powerful invest heavily in political activity to promote their inter-ests and block progressive reforms.

*****

The middle and upper classes also hold the most important posts in government, elected and appointed alike. They share a common set of ideas and values predicated on protecting the status quo and repressing any major challenge to that system, partic-ularly those that come from the working class and the Left.

*****

The tax revenues or debt fi nancing governments rely on are directly related to the state of the capitalist economy and its rates of growth and prof i tability. If the level of economic activity declines — perhaps, because capitalists are unhappy about new Isn’t

*****

legislation that benef i ts workers — the state will fi nd it increasingly dif f i cult to fund its activities. This in turn leads to a decline in its legitimacy and its level of popular support.

*****

Often, if capitalists aren’t induced to make investments through business subsidies and other incentives, they simply will refuse to invest.

*****

It’s also how they’re able to conf l ate their own interests with a larger “public” or “national” interest — under a capitalist system, there’s some truth to their claim.

*****

So long as the funda-mental structures of the economy remain unchanged, state action will dispropor-tionately benef i t capitalist interests at the expense of everything else.

*****

Simply electing politicians to of f i ce or watching the government expand by its own momentum has never been, and never will be, enough. Economic power is political power, and under capitalism the owners of capital will always have the capacity to undermine popular democracy

*****

Winning government power and using it to break the dominance of the capitalist class is a necessary condition for beginning the transition to socialism.

*****

The bitter experiences of the twentieth century have taught us that socialism won’t further the cause of human freedom if the political and administrative struc-tures of government aren’t thoroughly democratized.
In the absence of popular organization and militancy, government action will do little to shift the balance of power away from capital and toward labor.
Isn’t America already kind of socialist?

*****

In order to withstand the inevitable backlash from capitalist and conservative forces, a socialist transition would need to draw on mass popular sup-port and direct participation in the af f airs of government.

*****

Only under these conditions would government activity be synonymous with democratic socialism

*****

No, socialism isn’t just more government — it’s about democratic ownership and control.

The ABCs of Socialism

But at least capitalism is free and democratic, right?

*****

Erik Olin Wright

*****

many take for granted that freedom and democracy are inextri-cably connected with capitalism.

*****

To say that capitalism restricts the fl our-ishing of these values is not to argue that capitalism has run counter to freedom and democracy in every instance. Rather, through the functioning of its most basic processes, capitalism generates severe def i -cits of both freedom and democracy that it can never remedy.

*****

At the core of these values is self- determination: the belief that people should be able to decide the conditions of their own lives to the fullest extent pos-sible. When an action by a person af f ects only that person, then he or she ought to be able to engage in that activity without asking permission from anyone else. This is the context of freedom. But when an action af f ects the lives of others, then these other people should have a say in the activity. 
This is the context of democracy. In both, the paramount concern is that people retain as much control as possible over the shape their lives will take.

*****

What we need, therefore, is a set of rules to distinguish between questions of freedom and those of democracy. In our society, such a distinction is usually made with reference to the boundary between the private and public spheres.

*****

it is forged and maintained by social processes

*****

The state vigorously enforces some public/private boundaries and leaves others to be upheld or dissolved as social norms. Often the boundary between the public and the private remains fuzzy.

*****

Capitalism constructs the boundary between the public and private spheres in a way that constrains the realization of true individual freedom and reduces the scope of meaningful democracy. There are fi ve ways in which this is readily apparent.

*****

1. “Work or Starve” Isn’t Freedom

*****

It is also the ability to act posi-tively on one’s life plans — to choose not just an answer, but the question itself.

It = Freedom

*****

Poverty in the midst of plenty exists because of a direct equa-tion between material resources and the resources needed for self-determination.

*****

2. Capitalists Decide

*****

The way the boundary between the public and private spheres is drawn in capitalism But at least capitalism is free and democratic, right?

*****

excludes crucial decisions, which af f ect large numbers of people, from democratic control.

*****

Even if one argues that this concentration of power in private hands is necessary for the ef f i cient allocation of resources, the exclusion of these kinds of decisions from democratic control unequivocally decimates the capacity for self-determination by all except the owners of capital.

*****

3. Nine to Five Is Tyranny

*****

An essential component of a business owner’s power is the right to tell employees what to do. That is the basis of the employment contract:

*****

autonomy is given or withheld at the owner’s pleasure.

*****

4. Governments Have to Serve the Interests of Private Capitalists

*****

Private control over major investment decisions creates a constant pressure on public authorities to enact rules favorable to the interests of capitalists.

*****

Democratic values are hollow so long as one class of citizens takes priority over all others.

*****

5. Elites Control the Political System

*****

is not only wealthy individuals, but also capitalist corporations, that face no meaningful restriction on their

*****

ability to deploy private resources for polit-ical purposes. This dif f erential access to political power voids the most basic prin-ciple of democracy.

*****

*****

When the political conditions are right, the anti-democratic and freedom-impeding features of capitalism can be palliated, but they cannot be eliminated. Taming capitalism in this way has been the cen-tral objective of the policies advocated by socialists within capitalist economies the world over.
But if freedom and democracy are to be fully realized, capitalism must not merely be tamed. It must be overcome.

*****

It might seem that way, but genuine freedom and democracy aren’t compatible with capitalism
