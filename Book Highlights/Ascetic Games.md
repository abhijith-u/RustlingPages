Ascetic Games
Dhirendra K Jha

Hinduism does not have a central authority or an overarching church-like organisation. Monastic orders that belong to a great number of sampradayas, or traditions, are at the core of this religion. The sadhus in these sampradayas, most often celibate monks, act as spiritual leaders for the lay followers.

*****

Monastic orders of the Vaishnava or Shaiva traditions—Vishnu or his incarnates, like Ram or Krishna, are the principal deity of the former, and Shiva of the latter—control most of the ascetic space of Hinduism. Their strength is showcased in the largest Hindu religious gathering, the Kumbh Mela, held every twelve years in each of the four cities—Allahabad, Haridwar, Nasik and Ujjain—which

*****

The two monastic orders have their own sets of mutts and ashrams, some of which have ambiguous institutional and power hierarchies, while others work autonomously. But all of them are ultimately linked to their respective akharas, originally conceived as the militant wing of Hindu monasticism.

*****

Nagas—the name literally means naked—are a class of both Shaiva and Vaishnava sadhus—who are directly attached to akharas, although it is the Shaiva nagas who are better known in the world outside

*****

This class of sadhus acted as warrior ascetics in the past.

*****

is different from the rest of the Shaiva akharas in that its ascetics refer to themselves not as nagas but as brahmacharis, having come from, as they claim, the Brahmin caste. In the other six akharas, nagas, who belong to different castes, occupy the prime position.

Ramanandis, a Vaishnava order founded by the fourteenth-century philosopher Ramanandacharya. This Vaishnava subsect accounts for the largest number of Hindu sadhus in the country, and form the three major Vaishnava akharas—Nirvani, Nirmohi and Digambar. The principal seats of power of these three akharas are in Ayodhya

*****

Vaishnava and Shaiva sadhus are quite distinct from each other. While Vaishnava sadhus are referred to as vairagis, meaning detached or dispassionate, Shaiva sadhus are called sanyasis or renunciates. Their garments and sect marks are distinct too. Vairagis wear white garments, while the sanyasis wear saffron. While the vairagis usually draw three vertical lines on their forehead, primarily with sandalwood (the pattern varies from one subsect to another), the sanyasis use sacred ash, or vibhuti, to draw horizontal lines.

*****

Together, these thirteen akharas form the All India Akhara Parishad (AIAP), a steering committee that organises the Kumbh Mela.

*****

In the past, the nagas preferred to be left alone, and their reputation ensured that devotees kept away too. But these days they can be seen enjoying their star status

*****

Today, akharas are desperate to hide the truth of having completely lost touch with their spiritual past. The economic and financial stakes of most monastic establishments and prominent sadhus have grown enormously.

*****

The influence of Hindutva, which was consolidated in the 1960s, gained unusual pace during the 1980s and threw the old monastic orders of Hinduism out of gear. The sadhus don’t seem to have grasped the long-term implications of their entanglement with politics on such a large scale. This monumental shift, along with the exponential rise in the income and influence of prominent religious establishments and spiritual leaders, triggered a dramatic change in the trends and texture of everyday expressions of Hinduism.

*****

As they set out to exploit this new opportunity, asceticism—their core strength—became the first casualty. But as good entrepreneurs, well aware of the market demand, they devised ways and manoeuvres to keep their ascetic image intact—a precondition for surviving in the political market of spirituality.

*****

Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, the second chief, or sarsanghchalak, of the RSS, held a meeting with a select group of religious leaders on 29 August 1964 in Bombay.1 The Vishva Hindu Parishad was born out of that meeting and has since been a two-tier structure—while a group of RSS pracharaks acts as the core of the body, a vast network of prominent sadhus of various Hindu religious sects formulate Hindu perspectives not just on social but also on political issues, to be propagated to other Hindus.

*****

Up until the formation of the VHP, the Hindu Mahasabha and Akhil Bharatiya Ram Rajya Parishad had been the leading  political forums for religious leaders interested in Hindu communalist politics.

*****

The VHP’s prospects started looking up after 1984, when it was virtually relaunched with the Ram Janmabhoomi issue as its prime objective.

*****

Without the VHP laying the ground in this manner, it is questionable whether the BJP could have survived politically after winning just two seats in the Lok Sabha elections of 1984.

*****

What is most interesting from an iconographical point of view is the way in which this double agency engineered a two level message throughout the event. ‘Hard-core’ and ‘soft-core’ imagery occurred side by side.

*****

The VHP’s strategy was formulated to allow sadhus to lend their support to RSS’s political project without being held back by moral concerns.

*****

Gods and goddesses revered by large numbers of people and whose characteristics best lent themselves to Hindu supremacist ideology—such as Ram and Durga—became the VHP’s chosen deities.

*****

The demolition of Babri masjid built by Muslim emperor Babur not only represented a triumph of political Hinduism but also—as most sadhus believe—the culmination of a long battle for supremacy between Hinduism and Islam in India.

*****

Part of the reason why the VHP so easily stormed these Hindu monastic orders was their own distorted understanding of their past;

*****

that there was once a golden age when their fighting skills drove politics in India,

*****

However, the sadhus’ armed ancestors were motivated by other ambitions, unlike what their descendants believe. Early records of militant nagas show that, during the medieval period, they behaved like any other group of professional fighters—driven by money rather than any grand political agenda. They frequently took up assignments as mercenaries and worked like small-scale guerrilla armies during the seventeenth, eighteenth and even early nineteenth centuries.

*****

Sir Jadunath Sarkar records the number of naga bands of Shaiva and Vaishnava sadhus who fought in numerous battles for the rajas of Rajputana, Gujarat and other regions—both defensive and aggressive—and in turn were rewarded with grants of land and annual allowances.7 During all of eighteenth century, they were employed in service to the maharajas of Udaipur, Jaipur, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Baroda, Marwar, Bhuj and many other kingdoms, and in many instances were part of a regularly paid standing army

render service to Safdar Jang and then his successor, Shuja-ud-Daulah. They proved their loyalty to their Mughal patron  against the Hindu raja of Banaras, Balwant Singh. When Shuja-ud-Daulah joined forces with Afghans, the nagas also fought against the Marathas.

*****

other armed sanyasis—sometimes in their own bands and at other times in league with Muslim fakirs and the impoverished peasantry of Bengal—locked horns with the region’s new master, the East India Company.

*****

described as everything from a precocious guerrilla war for India’s independence to a haphazard outbreak of banditry

*****

By the beginning of the nineteenth century, armed ascetic activity started declining fast.

*****

British rule meant that there was less and less scope for warrior ascetics to operate as they used to. Opportunities in the armies of princely states also declined due to strained finances and because they often had British representatives posted in their court.

*****

They adapted to the changing political environment and economic pattern in northern India and diversified, in no time, into urban-property ownership and money lending, post 1802

*****

Even today, almost half of Ayodhya and Haridwar is owned by Vaishnava and Shaiva akharas, respectively.

*****

As generations passed, the history of the nagas underwent a metamorphosis and gave birth to a firmly embedded myth. This myth-history goes that the nagas took up arms to protect the Hindu religion and that they were the last line of defence against foreign invaders, both Muslim and British. The truth, however, is  that the armed ancestors of present-day sadhus were mercenaries who served transient masters of any shade of faith.

*****

Yet, the myth persisted and could not be cut away by the truth. It gave nagas an unshakeable belief in their destiny to guide the future of politics in India.

*****

The relationship between a guru and a chela, which is at the heart of Ramanandi akharas, is underlaid with turbulence. Outsiders might not see this or skim over it—because of the veil of religion—but anybody with even a surface view of the akharas cannot remain blind to it. It even finds a mention in Ayodhya’s folklore:

*****

(He became a sadhu by massaging feet,
And a mahant by choking a throat;

*****

The VHP, for almost two decades after its inception in 1964, had been unable to use the sadhus in creating a favourable electoral condition for the BJP. This failure led the RSS to re-launch the VHP in the early 1980s with the prime motive of spearheading a new political strategy.

*****

The lack of support from the ascetic community of Ayodhya, the epicentre of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, threatened to disrupt its new agenda.

*****

The VHP’s campaign in Ayodhya was conducted by a handful of Ramanandi vairagis who had little support from the rest of the community, and, in the end, not much was accomplished.

*****

it set up a Ram Janmabhoomi Trust and conferred its chairmanship on Jagat Guru Ramanandacharya Shivaramacharya, head of the Ramanandis of Varanasi, the holy town located close to Ayodhya. It was a shrewd move, because Shivaramacharya, said to command immense respect throughout Vaishnava circles, would help swing the majority of Ramanandis to the VHP, particularly in Ayodhya. Having set up the trust, with which BJP leader Vijaya Raje Scindia and a number of corporate representatives, like G.P. Birla, G.H. Singhania, K.N. Modi and R.N. Goenka, were associated, the VHP called on the government to transfer the property rights of the disputed site in Ayodhya to the trus

*****

But the movement was still not particularly successful at the local level in Ayodhya,10 and this seemed to get on the VHP’s nerves.

*****

The VHP desperately needed pliable mahants in Ayodhya’s temples. For ambitious ascetics, this provided a new opportunity as well as readily available help to accrue material prospects or grab lucrative mahantships in Ayodhya.

*****

‘In the name of temple movement, the VHP singlehandedly destroyed the tranquillity of Ayodhya. Violence, moneypower and political influence were used openly by it to get favourable mahants installed in the temples here. Goons in the garb of sadhus became powerful. Old and vulnerable mahants became victims. The dignity that the sadhus of Ayodhya have lost, because of the VHP’s direct or indirect interference in deciding successions in temples here, can never be reclaimed.

*****

Between 1950 and 1984, except for legal battles, there had been no on-the-ground action, no movement to demand the Hindu occupation of Babri masjid. Pilgrims to Ayodhya were mostly lay devotees from rural or semi-urban regions, without any political agenda. The means of these devotees were limited, so were their reasons for visiting Ayodhya. With the revival of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, the town began to witness a spurt in the influx of religious tourists. This spiked further during the 1990s and thereafter. Many temples were converted into dharamshalas and the prices of real-estate possessions of these religious institutions shot up.

*****

Spirituality started dying fast, so did the tranquillity of Ayodhya and its sadhus.
The bohemian sadhus of the town were converted into, or replaced by, those desirous of owning properties and wielding their power.

*****

A good number of temples here have become shelters for criminals, who, after committing crime in other parts of the country, hide in Ayodhya in the garb of sadhus.

*****

Bereft of religious ethos and desirous of the power and wealth available at the temples, these sadhus might well have been willing pawns for the Sangh Parivar.

*****

What has made these machinations—whether of the VHP or otherwise—possible is the very nature of the properties attached to the temples. Legally, all the lands of the temples in Ayodhya are devottar, or endowed, lands owned by the presiding deities of the assorted religious establishments, and mahants are to act only as their managers. This means the temple properties cannot be owned by the mahants, only possessed.

*****

the Property Dissipation Act of UP,

*****

selling and purchasing is carried out by the possessor on behalf of the presiding deity and the commissioner’s permission is hardly ever sought. Though illegal, such transactions occur regularly.

*****

The succession of land in a religious establishment in Ayodhya is guided by the Riwaz-e-Aam, the customary law of Ayodhya’s vairagis,

*****

a guru in a spiritual family of Ayodhya is always succeeded by a disciple, or a co-disciple, or disciple’s disciple, or nephew-disciple—disciple of a guru-brother or guru-sister—and so on.

*****

But there is no guarantee that things will go smoothly even if a mahant nominates his successor well in advance. By writing a will, the mahant actually risks becoming a burden and a threat simultaneously. The moment a mahant writes his will, the nominee no longer needs him. So long as the mahant is alive, the nominee lives in constant fear that his guru might change his mind. In Ayodhya, there is a rather disturbing trend of an abnormally high number of mahants dying mere days or weeks after writing their will.

*****

rarely do sadhus allow post-mortem of the deceased,’ said Varma. The Ramanandi nagas believe that after a sadhu’s death his body must be submerged in the river Sarayu without being mutilated.
What more could a murderer want?

*****

Hanumangarhi, the de facto centre of Ayodhya, plays a pivotal role in this fratricidal war between sadhus.

*****

As the baithak, or main seat of power, of Nirvani akhara, it houses over 600 naga vairagis, who act in gangs and treat the landed property of Ayodhya as their own, emboldened by the brute force they brandish proudly.

*****

‘Their modus operandi is simple. First they capture the body of the deceased, and then his temple.’

*****

The local administration often stays clear of such disputes. Even if a case is filed by the real claimant, the occupier uses the mahazarnama as well as the resources of the newly occupied temple to defend his claim to the mahantship. The civil court in Faizabad overflows with such disputes. The real claimants in most cases are helpless. The nagas of Hanumangarhi band together, and are too powerful to be defeated.
Even when there is a clear claim to the title, the would-be mahant is unlikely to succeed against the Hanumangarhi nagas.

*****

The other religious establishment that is notorious for its fierce ascetics is Mani Ram Das Ki Chhawani, a temple complex known as Chhoti Chhawani, also in Ayodhya

*****

Like the nagas of Hanumangarhi, the residents of Chhoti Chhawani are also known for taking a keen interest in the succession of mahants and the management of temples in Ayodhya, and for working ruthlessly to expand their influence. Even though the two groups are careful not to engage in any direct showdown, they have virtually divided the town into two camps.

*****

Violent coups by disciples desperate to grab mahantships—often helped by outside forces acting for political or financial reasons—have, in particular, ruined the relationship between gurus and chelas. It is unlikely that any other Hindu religious establishment in the country knows such toxic levels of distrust in that most sacred of bonds.

*****

In Ayodhya, this very relationship has now come under huge strain. The forcible expropriation of mahantship has injected a massive dose of suspicion in an association that was once akin to a parent–child relationship.

*****

It is largely in this backdrop that mahants, haunted by an obsessive need for security in their old age, have increasingly started falling back on their relatives

*****

Theoretically, as per the Ramanandi tradition, an ascetic is supposed to observe strict celibacy and remain cut off from his family, burning his attachments through ascetic initiation

*****

The theoretical world of naga vairagis is a far cry from what they practise.

*****

The boy disciples whom they initiate into their order are often their illegitimate sons, and it is to such disciples that they bequeath the lands given to them for the purpose so entirely different.

*****

The great majority of young vairagis to whom I spoke remarked that their future seemed bleak because, by and large, mahants have been appointing their relatives as successors.

naga followers of Gyan Das—who abhorred the VHP’s interference in Hanumangarhi’s affairs—and Dharam Das—a highly ambitious ascetic who had gained status and influence by leveraging his connection to the Sangh Parivar.

*****

then Congress prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao. It is when Rao set out to break the bond that had emerged between the sadhus and the Sangh Parivar in the aftermath of the Babri masjid demolition in 1992,

*****

Gyan Das also had the blessings of Chandraswami—a powerful godman who was Rao’s guru and hence among the first to be deployed by him to rupture the bond between Ayodhya’s sadhus and the VHP, and to thwart the Sangh Parivar’s attempts to exploit the Babri masjid–Ram Janmabhoomi issue for political gains.

*****

Chandraswami’s first step towards achieving the task assigned to him by Rao was to organise a gathering of 300 sadhus and dharmacharyas in Delhi in April 1993. Gyan Das played a key role in this exercise.

*****

One of the main resolutions adopted in the meeting urged Hindu religious figures to abjure politics.5

*****

Chandraswami also organised a som yagya ritual in Ayodhya, aimed at breaking the monopoly of the Sangh Parivar in the temple town and making a parallel show of the vairagis’ strength. That the venture had the patronage of the Centre could not remain a secret.

*****

Later, when Rao decided to work on a new plan to break the BJP’s consolidation among the sadhus, Gyan Das participated with equal enthusiasm. This time, instead of Chandraswami, Rao relied on the shankaracharyas of the four main peethas, or monasteries, believed to have been set up by Adi Shankara—Jyotish peetha in Uttarakhand in the north, Sringeri peetha in  Karnataka in the south, Govardhan peetha in Orissa in the east and Dwarka peetha in Gujarat in the west

*****

In this meeting, they decided to constitute an independent, apolitical and religious body to oversee the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, and called upon the Central government to hand over the disputed land to this body.8 The government had acquired the land through an ordinance in the aftermath of Babri masjid’s demolition.

*****

the Congress-backed Ramalaya Trust—as against the one founded by the VHP—to build a Ram temple

*****

Soon, however, the trust fell into disuse because of differences among the shankaracharyas and because the high court belied their hopes of an early judgement on the issue. Yet, the exercise succeeded in dividing the sadhus and ensuring the emergence of Gyan Das as the counter force to the VHP in Ayodhya.

*****

the VHP mounted its attack on Gyan Das in 2005, through its point man Dharam Das, control over the Nirvani akhara had become the focal point of the RSS outfit’s efforts in Ayodhya

*****

Ramanandi akharas were founded primarily to protect vairagis from the violent attacks of sanyasis and to free Vaishnava religious places from the clutches of Shaivas. There is evidence of how, for centuries, Shaiva and Vaishnava ascetics had been at loggerheads and had killed one another in fairly large numbers.

*****

Some of these are well recorded, including the massacre of Vaishnava sadhus by Shaiva sadhus at Nasik in 1690 and a violent fight between the two groups at Haridwar in 1760

*****

sometime in the late seventeenth century,

formed the three anis14—Nirvani, Nirmohi and Digambar—which were then subdivided into akharas, the places where the militant ascetic members called astradharis, or bearers of arms, would reside.
This structure of the Ramanandi akharas continues till date.

*****

The site where Hanumangarhi stands today was in the possession of the Shaiva sadhus of Juna akhara until the early eighteenth century. It was only after a bloody fight that Vaishnava nagas of Nirvani akhara, led by their legendary shri mahant Baba Abhay Ram Das, succeeded in capturing what is referred to in the eighteenth century records as Hanuman Tilla

*****

Later, under the patronage of the nawabs of Awadh, who had succeeded the Mughals as the dominant rulers in north India in the early eighteenth century, Hanuman Tilla was first converted into a temple and then a fortress—Hanumangarhi—and it acquired a central position in Ayodhya.17 Soon it became the baithak of Nirvani akhara,

cow slaughter. This issue had been fiercely debated in 1948–49 in the constituent assembly between secularists like Nehru on the one  hand and Congress traditionalists and Hindu revivalists on the other. The debate resulted in the incorporation of this issue as one of the Directive Principles of State Policies, which, instead of being legally enforceable, are broad guidelines in the Constitution that governments are expected to bear in mind while framing state-level policy

*****

over one lakh sadhus descended on Parliament Street on 7 November 1966 and went on to gherao Parliament House, demanding a prohibition on cow slaughter. Police had to resort to firing when repeated tear-gassing and lathi-charging failed to stop the violent mobs from trying to get inside ‘Parliament House and All India Radio and attacking buildings along the way and setting fire to over 100 cars and a dozen buses

*****

Nanda, the union home minister, tried to extricate himself from the mess

*****

Indira Gandhi, who had remained firm all through the agitation, sacked him.

*****

Indira Gandhi’s resolute stance left the sadhus high and dry. They were chased, caned, arrested and shot at. Even three hours of holding Parliament Street hostage had delivered absolutely nothing to them

*****

The debacle of this anti-cow slaughter agitation left a large section of the sadhus disillusioned and they did not respond to the VHP’s calls at the next Kumbh Mela held in Allahabad in 1977.

*****

Instead, the sadhus provided an overwhelming welcome to Indira Gandhi in a meeting to honour her at the 1977 Kumbh, organised by the shankaracharya of Jyotish peetha

*****

The general anti-Congress wave, quite visible in most parts of northern India at that time, hardly touched the sadhus attending the Kumbh.

*****

In the decade after the failed march of sadhus on Parliament Street, the VHP, despite all its efforts, was unable to regain the sadhus’ confidence. In fact, the Kumbh Mela of 1977 only accelerated the VHP’s free fall.

*****

Things might have not worked out in the VHP’s favour had a large number of swayamsevaks and pracharaks not infiltrated the ranks of sadhus. Although this infiltraton began in the early 1980s, it intensified towards the end of the decade.

*****

Not only did they bolster the VHP’s efforts to use mass ritual actions and religious imageries for the political mobilisation of Hindus but also laid the foundation for what the RSS outfit had been longing for—transformation of the Kumbh Mela into a massive political opportunity.

*****

A three-day Dharma Sansad was organised by the VHP in the last week of January 1989. The Dharma Sansad is a conclave of sadhus, unlike the World Hindu Conference, which is attended by ordinary supporters of the RSS as well as sadhus. Both continue to be conducted till this day, with the former being the bigger focus. The Dharma Sansad became notable for the large participation of sadhus as well as for its uber militant tone

*****

These meetings, speeches and propaganda using the platform of the 1989 Allahabad Kumbh provided an unprecedented edge to Hindutva politics. In days to come, the VHP built on this momentum to mobilise sadhus as well as devout Hindus for its Ayodhya project. The series of events this Kumbh Mela set off—including Advani’s rath yatra in 1990—culminated in the demolition of the Babri masjid

*****

In the 1990s, after the demolition of the Babri masjid, prominent sadhus and akharas went back to focusing on their day-to-day  activities, managing real estate properties and hobnobbing with politicians of all kinds, although it was clear that the BJP had greater penetration among them. This was also the time when sadhus belonging to Other Backward Castes (OBCs) started becoming more assertive in what was an upper-caste-dominated world.

*****

Yet, the impact of the OBC assertion among the sadhus was largely limited because the large number of RSS-workers-turned-sadhus acted as sheet anchor, keeping the VHP’s support base stable.

*****

it was partly to offset the disruption caused by OBC reservations that the VHP, firmly backed by the new class of sadhus, increased the pitch of its rhetoric during the subsequent Kumbh Mela held at Allahabad in 2001.

*****

The VHP’s rhetoric became even shriller in the 2013 Allahabad Kumbh when it strongly urged ascetics to communicate to Hindus across the country that supporting the BJP and Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was a divine project.

*****

How the Sangh Parivar used the new class of sadhus and what was achieved in the bargain is no small feat. Using the Kumbh Mela to spread political messages has been the long-standing  dream of various political groups. But even the most popular of Indian leaders, like Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru failed to connect with the akharas as effectively as the VHP.

*****

Immediately after his return to India from South Africa, Gandhi made his way to Haridwar for the Kumbh Mela in 1915. He was quite keen to be at the great religious gathering and was eager to meet with the sadhus of Haridwar. He had expected a utopian world of respectful holy men, but he was sorely disappointed.

*****

Though Gandhi’s initial eagerness to recruit sadhus to the nationalist cause was extinguished by the overwhelming narrowness of mind displayed by the akharas, Kumbh Melas continued to attract a section of Congress leaders, such as Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Madan Mohan Malaviya and even Nehru, who saw it as a platform that could carry their propaganda deep into  the country. They were not yet ready to accept that a religious congregation of this kind was too narrow and tradition-bound to act as a conduit for an inclusive nationalism.

*****

In the present day, the spread of modern education and proliferation of other sources of income has meant that Hindu monastic orders no longer get enough new entrants. RSS pracharaks, though, are a readymade breeding ground for Hindu asceticism. Pracharaks perhaps begin with idealism, setting out to steer the nation towards the RSS’s vision and protect what they are taught is the true nature of Hinduism, all the while living the life of a wanderer and surviving on contributions from swayamsevaks. When the initial enthusiasm starts to fade, their options are limited to either making a U-turn and becoming householders or shifting to active politics. But not everyone can easily make that switch. For those who can’t, Hindu asceticism offers a sustained source of income and sometimes even the possibility of crawling up the ladder if they can muster clout with the Sangh Parivar.

*****

On 4 February 2013, just when the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad was at its peak, the media blew the lid off this spectacle, reporting that ‘many akharas’ were parading ‘fake nagas’ during the shahi julus

*****

indicating that the akharas had hired non-nagas for money in order to inflate the number of nagas in the procession.

*****

The Kumbh  Mela, to these akharas, is an occasion for the nagas to collectively showcase the strength they claim to have wielded through the ages. That strength is their unique selling point—it is not enough that they once possessed it; they must be seen to possess it now as well. This mythical strength has to be demonstrated, even if symbolically, from time to time in order to retain the devotees’ awe.

*****

Perhaps, the akharas would not feel the need to perpetuate the stereotype if they had continued to get enough new entrants and if Kumbh Melas were just a straightforward religious fair for ascetics and devotees. But during the last few decades, there has been a paucity of naga aspirants and there has been a powerful effort to convert the Kumbh into a political theatre. All this seems to have pushed the Dasanami akharas to the edge, forcing them to deploy desperate measures to make the show look grand. Most sadhus have had to adjust to a new way of life, one in which spirituality has been replaced by manufactured acts to keep up appearances.

*****

For their part, akharas remain opaque and highly secretive, preferring to divert attention away from their crisis rather than to examine it. It is true that the akharas are fighting for survival. But the harder they fight the waters closing over them, the faster they seem to be drowning.

*****

In the medieval ages, various princely rulers, both Hindus and Muslims, used to hire the services of organised akharas for battles, which, in turn, attracted a good number of youths, particularly those belonging to the lower strata of society in north India. A large number of ascetic warriors continued to bear arms and to rent out their fighting services even during the early years of the British rule in India. Naturally, their numbers were much larger in parts not under the East India Company’s rule.

*****

But the number of warrior ascetics started declining as the British rule reduced the probability of princely states fighting among themselves. Private armies could neither be kept nor assembled

*****

Nevertheless, the nagas and their akharas survived, continuing to get patronage from the remnants of the medieval order—local rajas and zamindars.

*****

Once the rajas were derecognised and zamindari estates were abolished after Independence, the patronage of the local ruling elite ended,

*****

It remained an alternative lifestyle and strategy for many youths from poverty-stricken parts of the Gangetic plain,

*****

That asceticism also acted as an adaptive strategy for survival has been explained quite vividly by Gross12—a fact that most ascetics today will vehemently deny, choosing to instead give philosophical reasons for their choice.

*****

But change has been rapid in the last few decades. The de-ruralisation of the Indian economy and the spread of modern education have opened up new avenues for those social groups that had until recently been the recruiting ground for akharas, particularly in north India. The life of a naga ascetic today neither has the glamour nor is a viable alternative for sustenance, as it was in the earlier times.

*****

One of the reasons the akharas, particularly the bigger ones, became conscious of their image could be the media boom during this period. Though every Kumbh in the past had been a religious spectacle, the 2001 Allahabad Kumbh was arguably the first one to receive massive international press coverage.

*****

The temptation to outshine other akharas and seize the limelight during the Kumbh Mela’s grand spectacle, the shahi snan, is something that at least some of the Dasanami akharas are not able to resist.

*****

Small wonder that akharas today are run by people who see the business of religion as being about who’s up and who’s down, who’s in and who’s out. In such an environment, as Shivraj Giri remarked, ‘what brings a naga to the top is not his tapas or his superior intellectual ability but, more often, his intense desire for power, his ability to see an opportunity even in a crisis and his promptness in manipulating any crisis for his own benefit.’

*****

Akharas make huge profits from bestowing coveted titles that turn sadhus into preacher-leaders—an opportunity that sometimes lands them in embarassing controversies. In particular, the title of mahamandaleshwar granted by Shaiva akharas, and which comes with a hefty price tag, but has become a constant source of trouble for the akharas.

Dandis, paramhansas and nagas together constitute the Dasanami order and are initiated through the same rules of sanyas. The ascetics who continue to hold the danda, the staff, after having performed the ceremony of sanyas, are called dandis and those who give up the danda after seven days of initiation are called tyakta dandis. The dandi category of Dasanami sanyasis are invariably from the Brahmin caste, and the danda that they carry is a bamboo staff covered in saffron cloth. Shankaracharyas belong to this category of sanyasis. The tyakta dandis, on the other hand, are recruited from all the castes. They are futher subdivided into two groups: paramhansa and naga. Paramhansas follow the same initiation rites as dandis, while nagas have to pass through an additional stage of initiation, that of tang tode.

*****

until the beginning of the twentieth century, nagas used to attribute the highest honour to the dandis, whom they regarded as gurus, and in the Kumbh processions, nagas carried the palanquin of shankaracharyas, who were considered spiritual heads of all Dasanami sanyasis. ‘But in one Kumbha mela at Haridwar there was a dispute between the Dandis and the Paramhansas because the former were too proud of their being Brahmin and considered the Paramhansas and the  Nagas inferior. At this, the Nagas together with the Paramhansas refused to pay respect to the Dandis. Consequently, the Dandis also refused to initiate the Naga Digambaras as well as the Paramhansas into sannyasa, as had been the established custom. This necessitated the latter to have someone from their own group who must be a Brahmin and who was entitled to act as an Acharya for the sannyasa. And this led to the origin of the Acharya Mandaleswara.

*****

In course of time, they started calling themselves ‘mahamandaleshwars’ to claim greater distinction. Soon, the title became coveted, and many paramhansas started spending ‘considerable money for getting the distinction’ of a mahamandaleshwar

*****

In any case, the title benefits both parties—the ascetic obtaining it as well as the akhara granting it. From the point of view of an ascetic, the title of mahamandaleshwar enormously enhances his or her position in the eyes of lay devotees. The widening of spiritual appeal has great bearing on the overall income of an ascetic.

*****

This practice has an interesting historical parallel. The relationship between akharas and mahamandaleshwars today, is similar to the one the akharas used to share with the princely states

*****

This also explains why mahamandaleshwars started proliferating around the mid-twentieth century when princely states started disappearing.

*****

Radhe Maa is a well-known controversial example. But there are others too: take the cases of Martand Puri and Swami Nithyananda, mahamandaleshwars of Mahanirvani akhara, who were awarded the coveted title at the 2013 Allahabad Kumbh.

*****

One consequence of the mushrooming of mahamandaleshwars was visible in the 2013 Allahabad Kumbh, where a section of them, emboldened by their sheer numbers, tried to bring together all the title-holders on one platform

*****

Mahamandaleshwar Parishad

*****

no sooner had the Parishad been formed than Dasanami akharas swung into action and questioned the rationale of the newly formed body.

*****

The most striking aspect of the akharas’ clampdown on the Mahamandaleshwar Parishad was that it was instant and unanimous; the akharas were determined to guard their position as the focal point of the Kumbh. Mahamandaleshwars, as compared to akharas, are in direct touch with lay devotees—they hold satsangs and deliver religious and spiritual discourses, which helps them wield influence over devout Hindus. Akharas encourage such activities by mahamandaleshwars;

*****

But if they act collectively—with mahamandaleshwars attached to all the different akharas joining forces and passing resolutions on various religious, social and political issues—there is a good chance that at some point the club of mahamandaleshwars would outweigh the exotic appeal  of Dasanami akharas, affecting the power balance between the two.

*****

A large number of ramanandacharyas, mahamandaleshwars and shankaracharyas owe their success to the VHP. But there are also, curiously, some ramanandacharyas who, unable to come up with the constant stream of money needed to maintain the title, simply run away.

*****

donations and offerings do not come just like that. The title is not sufficient to make you wealthy. You have to be a good orator to impress devotees and you have to know various tricks and have the kind of network required to spread your area of influence in order to motivate more and more wealthy people to become your disciples.

*****

Hindus consider the peetha of a shankaracharya to be the oldest surviving gaddi. The position is also highly lucrative because it attracts a large number of followers; the proliferation of shankaracharyas has been almost as fast as that of mahamandaleshwars.

*****

According to Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, there are over 100 shankaracharyas today. He also claimed that their numbers continue to swell.

*****

Varanasi, in particular, has become a manufacturing hub of shankaracharyas.

*****

Even the four main peethas, those that quite vociferously claim a direct link to Adi Shankara, are not free of controversies and rival claimants

*****

Kanchi peetha claims that Adi Shankara founded five peethas, and that he himself was the first acharya of Kanchi peetha and his four disciples became the pontiffs at the four peethas recorded in Mathamanaya. Sringeri, on the other hand, asserts that Kanchipuram is its branch mutt and not an independent peetha.

*****

The VHP knew that it could not launch an open battle against the shankaracharyas of the four peethas without drawing the ire of the Hindu constituency. Neither could it overlook the fact that it did not have the support of the topmost seers of the Dasanami structure. Therefore, it sought to undermine the shankaracharyas of the four peethas by obtaining legitimacy from those shankaracharyas who were struggling to get their own claims to the title recognised.
It was no accident, therefore, that Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati of Kanchipuram joined the VHP bandwagon early on. He financed one of the two vehicles in which the VHP leaders toured Tamil Nadu after hundreds of Dalits converted to Islam in Meenakshipuram in 1981,11 which had made Brahminical and Hindutva organisations furious

*****

Another shankaracharya, whose association with the VHP is rooted in his aim to strengthen the claim of his peetha as one of the original ones, is Narendranand Saraswati, the pontiff of Sumeru peetha. This peetha does not find mention in Mathamanaya and getting it recognised by the orthodox circles has remained a major challenge for Narendranand.

*****

the shankaracharya whose services the VHP has used the most is not Narendranand Saraswati, but Vasudevanand Saraswati, who, with the backing of the Sangh Parivar, has claimed that he is the ‘real’ pontiff of Jyotish peetha in Uttarakhand.

*****

The Kashi Vidwat Parishad, a Varanasi-based body consisting of ‘learned’ persons from the Brahmin caste, has played a key role in the proliferation of shankaracharyas
